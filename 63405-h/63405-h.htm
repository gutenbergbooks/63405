<p class="summary">First trip to sea&mdash;Shipmates&mdash;Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren,
Bart, K.B.</p>

<p class="p2">My father<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and uncle both served their king and
country in the American war of independence; the
former was with Lord Cornwallis’s army when it
surrendered at York to the American forces under
the command of General Washington (he was at
that time an officer in the 6th Regiment of Foot);
and the latter in the 4th Dragoons. Both were
magistrates for the county of Buckinghamshire, and
served the office of high sheriff for the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>When scarcely ten years old, I joined H.M. ship
<i>Renown</i> (74) in Torbay, bearing the flag (blue at the
mizen) of one of the most amiable men in the service,
Sir John Borlase Warren, Bt, K.B., who had
commanded a squadron of dashing frigates during
all the early part of the war, and had taken and
destroyed several French ships, and finished his
glorious flying squad career by capturing most of
those, which, under the command of Monsieur Bompart,
had been sent with troops to assist the Irish
during the rebellion of 1798, thereby saving the
blood of thousands in Ireland, if not Ireland itself.
A better or braver officer than the late Admiral Sir
J. B. Warren never lived; he was that perfect model
of a gentleman that every one might take as a pattern.
I had the melancholy honour of following him
to his grave, and wept over it tears of unfeigned
sorrow.</p>

<p>But to commence my peregrinations. I still recollect
the delight that a letter from my father gave
me when at school, informing me I was to leave
Latin and Greek, which classical knowledge was all
blown overboard and forgotten the first gale of wind
at sea; and after spending a short time at Little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
Missenden Abbey (which then belonged to my father)
with my mother and two sisters,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> I proceeded to
Portsmouth, thence to find a passage to join the
before-mentioned ship in Torbay.</p>

<p>I bore the parting with my kind, dear, excellent
mother and sisters pretty well, because my father
accompanied me to Portsmouth to see me safely
launched into a new world; but when he took leave,
I thought my heart would burst with grief. Time,
however, reconciles us to everything, and the gaiety
and thoughtlessness of youth, added to the cocked
hat, dirk, spy-glass, etc., of a nautical fit out, assisted
wonderfully to dry my tears, and, in a manner, reconciled
me to a new scene of life.</p>

<p>Captain Pickmore, who at that period commanded
the <i>Royal William</i>, at Spithead, very kindly sent me
on board the <i>Montague</i> (74) with all my baggage, in
the admiral’s tender, to join my ship to the westward.
The first night on board was not the most pleasant;
the noises unusual to a novice&mdash;sleeping in a hammock
for the first time&mdash;its tarry smell&mdash;the wet cables for
a bed carpet, and a somersault or two from my
lubberly manner of getting into it, made me draw
comparisons between sleeping on beds of down ashore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
and my new abode, by no means very favourable to
the latter.</p>

<p>The second day after quitting Portsmouth brought
us to Torbay, where the channel fleet of thirty-six
sail of the line, under Lord Bridport, was lying at
anchor. I was soon transferred to my own ship, and
introduced to my new messmates.</p>

<p>We lived in the gun-room on the lower deck, and
in fine weather had daylight, which was better in
many respects than the old midshipmen’s berths in
the cockpit. Amongst the youngsters were some
within a year or two as young as myself; nice boys,
full of fun and mischief, who soon initiated me in the
sea pranks of “sawing your bed-posts,”&mdash;cutting you
down head and foot; “reefing your bed-clothes,”&mdash;making
them up into hard balls which, if properly
done, will take one unpractised in the art a good half-hour
or more to undo. It used to be a great annoyance
to come off deck after a first or middle watch
(from eight at night to twelve, or from twelve to four
in the morning), perhaps quite wet through, thinking,
on being relieved, what a nice sleep you would have,
to find, on going to your hammock, all your sheets
and blankets made up into hard balls, and a good half-hour’s
work in the dark to undo them, particularly
when tired and sleepy. During your labour to effect
this, you had the pleasure of hearing the mischievous
fellows that had a hand in doing it, laughing in their
hammocks, and offering their condolences by saying
what a shame it was to play such tricks when you
were absent on deck, keeping your watch, and recom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>mending
you to lick them all round, if you were able,
or at all events to retaliate the first opportunity.</p>

<p>Blowing the grampus (sluicing you with water), and
many other tricks used to be resorted to occasionally.
Taking it all in good part, from the persuasion that it
was the customary initiation to a sea life, my torments
were few, for when the art of tormenting ceases to
irritate, it loses the effect intended, and it generally
ends by your shipmates saying, “Well, you are a good-natured
fellow, and shall not be annoyed any more.”</p>

<p>I must do my brother mids the justice to say that
a more kind-hearted set was not to be met with. We
had few or no real quarrels the four years we sailed
together, and, whenever spare time permitted, our
evenings were spent in the amusements afforded by the
old games of cribbage, loo, draughts and able wackets,
which is a kind of forfeit played with cards, where
each player is subject, for every mistake, to one or more
blows with a knotted handkerchief on the palm of the
hand. Many of them have paid the debt of nature,
but some have risen to high rank and honours, most
deservedly, in the service. We were all kept tight at
work, and had at least four hours of sky-parlour
(being sent to the main-topmast-head), when our
watch was over, for every delinquency. I recollect
one of my messmates was a lazy fellow, and shocking
bad relief (the Hon. Henry Dawson); he always kept
the unfortunate mid he had to relieve at least half-an-hour
beyond his time on deck, until his patience
was exhausted, forcing him to the unwelcome alternative
of making a complaint to the lieutenant of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
watch, who sent down to bring his relief on deck.
It frequently happened that an old quarter-master,
named Ned Cowen, was employed on this errand;
he was a complete character, and as he had sailed
round the world with the celebrated Captain Cook,
and was a great favourite with us mids, we used to
get him into our berth, give the old fellow a glass or
two of grog, and make him relate his adventures.</p>

<p>Whenever old Ned presented himself at the Honble.
H. Dawson’s hammock, he signified the purport of
his visit with this summons&mdash;“Come, Mr. Dawson,
past one bell (the half-hour after the watch has been
called), turn out, show a leg, or I am ordered to bring
you up on the quarter-deck, hammock and all; take
my advice, bring a good, thick greatcoat with you; it
is a wet night, and the masthead waiting for you&mdash;the
old story, you know.” The delinquent’s tale of “overslept
myself, sir,” was quite worn out&mdash;it occurred too
often; therefore nothing was left but to mount up to
the masthead, and there enjoy the refreshing breezes,
fine showers, and exhilarating air of sky-parlour, to
awaken him from his balmy slumbers.</p>

<p>The ship was in fine order and a perfect man-of-war,
well manned and officered. The lieutenants were
good seamen, knew and did their duty promptly, and
managed the ship well.</p>

<p>Of the first lieutenants, two, after being promoted,
found a watery grave&mdash;poor Hawes, in the <i>Moucheron</i>,
brig of 16 guns, which foundered in a heavy gale with
all his crew; and the gallant Burke shared a similar
fate in the <i>Seagull</i>, of 18 guns.</p>

<p class="summary">Channel cruising&mdash;Boat expeditions&mdash;Anecdote of a gallant mid&mdash;Ditto
of two dandy Guardsmen&mdash;Expedition to Ferrol&mdash;Sir James
Pulteney, Sir Edward Pellew and the donkey&mdash;The unlucky cruise.</p>

<p class="p2">Our first cruise was with the channel fleet off Brest,
and to me, a boy of ten years old, it appeared a great
feat, blocking up a superior French one in their own
harbour, and offering them battle daily, without their
daring to come out of port.</p>

<p>The winter’s cruise of 1799 and spring of 1800 was
very stormy; nothing but heavy gales from S.W. to
N.W. to N.E. and E., which blew us nearly at one
time within sight of Ireland.</p>

<p>We had various commanders-in-chief, to each of
whom the sailors had given a peculiar nick-name.
The Honble. Admiral William Cornwallis was styled
“Billy Blue,” from his flag (blue at the main), and
hoisting, the moment we dropped anchor from the
S.W. gales in Torbay, a blue Peter&mdash;a hint for every
person to remain on board, ready to sail again the
moment the wind came round sufficiently to the
northward to enable the fleet to proceed down channel
to resume the blockade of Brest; Lord Bridport&mdash;“Lord
Bread-bags” (Jack’s pun upon his lordship’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
name); Admiral Sir Allan Gardner&mdash;“Old Junk,”
because he was a tough old fellow, and kept the ships
so long at sea upon salt junk; and Lord St. Vincent&mdash;“Sour
Crout,” from his stern deportment. The
latter had no sooner joined than he detached us with
the <i>Defence</i> (74), <i>Fisgard</i>, and <i>Beaulieu</i> frigates, under
our orders, into the Bay of Biscay, to annoy the coast
of France.</p>

<p>Our first attempt was at the Penmarks, where we
succeeded in cutting out several French <i>chasse-marées</i>,
and other craft, laden with brandy, wine, and provisions
for the fleet in Brest harbour. The boats were
commanded by the gallant Lieutenants Burke and
John Thompson, of the <i>Renown</i>. This service was
performed with little loss. Our next attempt was on
some armed vessels in the river Quimper, coast of
Brittany, but the boats did not succeed in finding the
vessels: they, suspecting a visit, had moved higher up
the river, whither it was not prudent to follow them.
The crews were, therefore, landed, and having succeeded
in destroying a fort at the entrance of the
river, they returned on board without loss.</p>

<p>The third attempt was at Noirmoutier, near the
mouth of the river Loire, in La Vendée&mdash;a tide harbour.
Success at first crowned our exertions; the boats
of the squadron, again under Lieutenants Burke, had
already burnt three vessels, mounting from 12, 18, to
24 guns, with some small craft, and were thinking of
returning, when the ebbing of the tide, which the gallant
assailants, carried away by their ardour, had failed
to perceive, left all the boats high and dry, exposed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
the fire of the French batteries. However, Lieutenants
Burke and Thompson, with a part of the men, dragged
a large fishing boat and our barge through the mud,
and got safe back to the ships, leaving the remainder
of the boats, with 76 of our best men and some
officers prisoners, besides a few killed and wounded.
A poor messmate of mine, a midshipman, named
Jago, who was afterwards killed in the Mediterranean
on another cutting-out affair, in remembrance of this
transaction, called out on that occasion to some of his
men who seemed disposed to hang back, “Come, my
lads, stick by me now, as you stuck by me in the mud
at Noirmoutier.”</p>

<p>In consequence of this untoward affair, we sailed
for Portsmouth to refit. Previous to sailing, the ship
was paid. I was stationed on the starboard gangway
to keep off the boats, but leaning too far over the
side, fell overboard, and got a good ducking, but fortunately
escaped breaking my head against a boat
that was alongside by falling between her and the
ship. Luckily the people in the boat picked me up
immediately, for at that time I could not swim.</p>

<p>After the ship had refitted, and obtained a draft of
seamen and marines, and new boats in lieu of those
we had lost on the coast of France, we joined the
fleet again off Brest, under the command of Earl
St. Vincent.</p>

<p>In August our admiral was detached with a strong
squadron to take the naval command of the expedition,
under General Sir James Pulteney, against Ferrol.</p>

<p>I recollect, on this expedition, two dandy young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
guardsmen came on board for a passage, and, being
too late for dinner in the ward-room, a nice beefsteak
and bottle of port wine was given them at a side table.
After contemplating it a little while, with a supercilious
turn of the mouth and nose, one of them made
the sage remark, that “he thought they might be able
to rough it pretty well with such fare every day in a
campaign; but, really, common port wine, beefsteaks,
and potatoes, was not fit food for guardsmen.” I’ll
answer for it long before their regiment returned from
Egypt they were very glad to get much worse fare,
and if either of them lived to serve with the noble
Wellington in the Peninsula, their pride of stomach
must have had many a fall.</p>

<p>The results of the unfortunate expedition to Ferrol
are too well known to need further record; the gallant
army, to a man, regretted that their evil genius placed
them under the command of such a general, and we,
of the navy, lamented our ill-luck that prevented us
from taking the beautiful Spanish fleet that lay at
anchor in the harbour.</p>

<p>It was reported&mdash;and, I believe, with truth&mdash;that
at the very time our troops were being re-embarked,
the Spanish governor had even sent out an officer
with the keys of the fortress in his hands, and an offer
of terms to surrender; but he, seeing how matters
stood, returned back to his general, rejoicing, and informed
him that the British army was in full retreat, and
part were already on board. The Spaniards had laid a
strong boom across the harbour, flanked by two very
powerful batteries&mdash;one on each side of the entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Sir James Pulteney promised to take the one on
the left, or larboard hand, while the boats, filled with
sailors and marines, were to storm the other at the
same time.</p>

<p>Seven sail of the line were prepared for action, with
springs on their cables, and a spare one out of the
gun-room stern port, bent to the sheet anchor, ready
for bringing up head and stern; in short, everything
was in a forward state for the attack, and the <i>London</i>
(98 guns) was to break the boom, and the rest of the
ships to follow in line of battle.</p>

<p>All hearts beat with joyful expectation, when, to
our utmost surprise and indignation, a signal was
made from the shore that the commander-in-chief of
the land forces had given up the idea of attack, and
boats were to be sent immediately to embark the
troops.</p>

<p>The gallant Sir Edward Pellew, who commanded
the <i>Impétueux</i> (74), was ready to burst with rage when
he found the object of the expedition given up, at a
time when it was almost within our grasp, and without
making one serious effort to obtain it. It was reported
in the squadron that he embarked an ass, and used to
go up to it, and take off his hat, and say, “How do
you do, Sir James? I hope nothing troubled you in
your sleep last night in the way of unpleasant dreams,
or that the nightmare did not disturb your rest.”</p>

<p>After this sad affair we sailed for Vigo Bay, where
our appearance with so large a force put the inhabitants
in bodily fear. When we were standing into the
bay a large French ship (privateer) was observed to haul<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
under the citadel. At night the boats of the squadron,
commanded by the daring Lieutenant Burke, were sent
to bring her out, which they most gallantly accomplished,
after a severe and desperate struggle. She was
called <i>La Guêpe</i>, of 18 long nine-pounders, with 244
men, sails bent, and perfectly ready for sea, and was
going to look after our homeward-bound West Indiamen,
and intended to have sailed the evening of the
day of our arrival.</p>

<p>She had her boarding nettings up, and everything
ready for a stout resistance. On the approach of the
boats the privateer and the forts opened a heavy fire of
round and grape, but they, nothing daunted, gave three
hearty cheers, dashed on, and, after a most gallant defence,
she was boarded and brought out. Lieutenant
Burke was severely wounded by a pike through both
thighs, and the French captain, who most heroically
fought his ship to the last moment, died of his wounds
an hour after she was taken. He asked (poor fellow!) if
he had done all he could to defend his ship; being
answered in the affirmative, and justly complimented
on his gallant conduct, he gave a faint smile, and
expired.</p>

<p>During the time we lay at anchor here we were in
the habit of sending a boat to haul the seine on the
Bayonne islands, and we were generally pretty successful.
Amongst other fish, we frequently caught
the torpedo<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>, which gave me a practical lesson of its
electric powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>On the 6th of September a tremendous heavy gale
came on from the southward and westward, in which
several vessels belonging to our convoy drifted from
their anchors, and went on shore. The <i>Stag</i>, frigate,
of 32 guns, Captain Winthrop, was wrecked upon Point
Subudo. However, we fortunately saved the crew;
but the men of some transports and merchant vessels
that went on shore in other parts of the bay fell into
the hands of the Spaniards. Not being able to get
the <i>Stag</i> off, she was burnt the same evening. The
moment the wind and weather permitted we sailed
with the expedition from Vigo Bay, and, having seen
them safe off the coast, the admiral, according to
orders, gave up his charge to Captain Sir Alexander
Cochrane, and proceeded off the Western Islands in
search of some Spanish galleons, said to be coming
home in a Portuguese convoy.</p>

<p>We had with us four sail-of-the-line, and three
frigates.</p>

<p>During our cruise we fell in thrice with a large
French ship (privateer), but her legs were too nimble
for us. One day, when we had all sail set, and were
carrying every stitch of canvass we could crowd in
chase, with a fine breeze, and nearing her fast, our
unlucky genius, which had attended us all this cruise,
from the sprite that said “Bo!” to old Pulteney at
Ferrol, still haunted us up to the present time. We
carried away our foretop-mast, and she again escaped.</p>

<p>The <i>Renown</i> being by far the best sailing ship of
the squadron, the others stood no chance with the
privateer, who very quietly hauled up her courses, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
no doubt enjoyed the fun of looking at us <i>hors de
combat</i>.</p>

<p>Two days after we fell in with two Portuguese
convoys from the Brazils, bound to Lisbon. One we
spoke; the others were boarded by the frigates to
windward. The Portuguese captains of the men-of-war
pledged their word of honour that no Spanish
ships were under their protection. We, like geese,
trusted to it, or rather, the frigates did. Will it be
believed that in the above convoy were the five Spanish
treasure-ships we were looking for, which arrived a
few days after safe at Lisbon! And when they passed
under the stern of the <i>Cynthia</i>, British sloop-of-war
that was lying there, they hauled down their Portuguese
colours, hoisted the Spanish, and fired a royal&mdash;and,
no doubt, joyful&mdash;salute; and well they might. They
had in the five vessels ten millions of specie, besides
valuable cargoes.</p>

<p>We afterwards heard that this business caused a
very angry communication from our Government to
that of Portugal; but they, like true diplomatists, threw
the whole blame from themselves on the weakest party,
by denying any knowledge of the transaction, dismissed
and imprisoned the captains of their men-of-war
for a short time, who on being released went to
Spain, and were there promoted to rank and honours.</p>

<p>After this <i>finale</i> of our unlucky cruise, we returned
to Plymouth to refit, and get provisions and water.
While there orders came to complete our stores of all
kinds for foreign service. Captain Thomas Eyles left
the ship, and Captain John Chambers White took the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
command&mdash;a strict, good, and excellent officer, who
has filled a high situation at Woolwich Dockyard since
the peace, and is now a Rear-Admiral of the White.
We were all delighted with the idea of getting away
from the heavy winter gales and monotonous cruising
of the channel fleet.</p>

<p>A word upon channel cruising. I defy any person
at the present day, except the old officers, to know the
constant anxiety of the captains and officers of the
channel fleet, sailing in two or three lines in heavy
gales and thick weather. It required great attention in
the lieutenants of the watch, a most strict and careful
look-out to prevent accidents, and to have their wits
always about them, ready to act at a minute’s warning.
By the good discipline kept up, the look-out was perfect,
and, to the <i>very great credit</i> of the officers of the
watch, <i>scarce an accident</i> occurred during the long,
tiresome, and harassing blockade of Brest, comprising
a period of more than twenty years.</p>

</div>

<p class="summary">Cruise off Cadiz&mdash;Proceed up the Mediterranean to Egypt after a
French squadron under Rear-Admiral Ganteaume, 1801.</p>

<p class="p2">In November, 1800, we sailed for Gibraltar. I was
much pleased to see the celebrated rock, so well defended
by the gallant Elliot in 1782, and to read, on
the spot, Colonel Drinkwater’s most amusing history
of that famous siege.</p>

<p>As late as the year 1801, the greater part of the
garrison was still covered with shot and broken shells,
thrown by the Spaniards at that period. They have
since been collected, and sold to be melted down for
various purposes, some probably to be again converted
into missiles of destruction.</p>

<p>We cruised off Cadiz in company with the <i>Dragon</i>,
<i>Hector</i>, and <i>Gibraltar</i>, of 74 guns each, until the spring
of 1801, detaining the Danish and Swedish vessels,
when a French squadron of eight sail of the line (some
frigates, and a store ship), having made their escape
from Brest, at a time the channel fleet was blown off,
passed us in the night, and pushed up the Mediterranean
for Toulon, to embark troops for Egypt, to
strengthen their force there.</p>

<p>The <i>Mercury</i> (28), Captain Rogers, and the <i>Incen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>diary</i>
(fire-ship), joined us in the morning, and informed
us they had been chased by them. Although we had
only four sail of the line, no time was lost in proceeding
after them; first touching at Gibraltar for provisions,
then running over to Marjarine Bay, on the
coast of Barbary, for water, and from thence to Port
Mahon, to see if chance would send us a reinforcement.
There we found the <i>Alexander</i> (74), Captain Sir Alexander
Ball, the <i>Généreux</i> (80), not half-manned, and
the <i>Harlaem</i> (64), <i>en flute</i>; however, they made a show
of strength, and to sea we went in search of the French
squadron, under Rear-Admiral Ganteaume, and steered
for Toulon. Ill fortune attended us; for in a heavy
gale, the <i>Généreux</i> rolled away all her top-masts,
and sprung a leak, which caused us to put back to
Minorca, with our crippled ships, from which place the
above-named ship was never again in a state to
accompany us.</p>

<p>The moment the rest of the squadron was ready for
sea, our persevering admiral again sailed, and although
with one ship less, he ventured to reconnoitre Toulon,
where we found the French had also put back damaged,
and were apparently employed in refitting. We, therefore,
shaped our course for Minorca. On our way
thither, to complete our water and provisions, we chased
a Spanish convoy into Cadeque, a small port near the
entrance of the Bay of Rosas; but the admiral did
not think, under existing circumstances, it was worth
while risking the loss of lives to attack them, having
the prospect of an action with a superior French
force in view; we, therefore, returned to Port Mahon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
to get ready to proceed after the enemy’s fleet in
Toulon.</p>

<p>During our stay, we heard that we were to be joined
at Malta by His Majesty’s ship <i>Athénienne</i> (64), which
was not even coppered, and had only half her complement
of men. Having put the ships into as good a
state as circumstances would admit, we proceeded to
Malta, and there picked up the 64 gun-ship, which
completed our ill-conditioned squadron, viz., five good
ships of the line, one 64, <i>en flute</i>, and another 64, half-manned,
and with no copper on her bottom.</p>

<p>With these ships we went to look for Admiral Ganteaume;
and off the island of Maretimo, we fell in with
the <i>Salamine</i> brig, of 16 guns, which gave us information
that the day before she had been chased by the
French squadron, and that by shaping our course to
south-east, we should probably see them next morning.
What joy ran through the different ships! but, alas!
owing to the ill-sailing of our squadron, all our hopes
were frustrated. We did, indeed, get sight of them the
following day at dawn, far to windward, and by a shift
of wind, shortly after brought them right a-head, so
that although there were no light airs, by sun-set we
could see more than halfway down their courses; yet
most of our ships, with the exception of the <i>Hector</i>
and <i>Dragon</i>, were very far astern, some hull down.
Still, however, we hoped with three good ships of the
line to bring their rear to action in the night, and so
retard them, that the next day our bad sailing ships
might pick up any birds we had winged, while we
stood on after the others; but bad fortune attended us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
our only frigate, the old <i>Mercury</i>, of 28 guns, sailed so
heavily as to be unable to keep them in view. At ten
at night, foggy, hazy weather came on, we lost sight of
our game, and the next morning the horizon was so
obscured that the enemy was no longer to be seen.</p>

<p>What was to be done? We knew Alexandria, or
some part of the coast of Egypt, was their destination,
and thither we steered. Ganteaume guessed we
should follow him thither, and, like a cunning old fox,
taking advantage of the hazy night, soon after dark
hauled his wind on the starboard tack, and doubled
round us; therefore, at daylight, in consequence of
the very thick state of the atmosphere preventing our
seeing him, we preceded him to the coast of Egypt,
while he shaped his course for Cape Derne Head, and
tried to land his troops a little to the westward of
Alexandria; but the few that attempted it were soon
murdered by the Arabs, and he, not feeling himself
quite at his ease for fear of our again meeting him,
returned back to Toulon to refit. After taking in
water and provisions, he once more proceeded to the
coast of Egypt, and although he did not land his men,
picked up His Majesty’s ship <i>Swiftsure</i> (74), Captain
Ben. Hallowell, who was obliged to surrender, after a
gallant defence, and took his prize safe into the harbour
of Toulon.</p>

<p>In the meantime we kept on our course for Alexandria,
and at the end of March arrived off there, and
joined the fleet of Lord Keith. Here a sad and heavy
affliction awaited our amiable admiral. The first news
was, that our gallant army had landed on the 8th, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
that his brave, handsome, and only son, who belonged
to the Coldstream Guards, had been killed on landing.
He bore his loss with the resignation of a Christian,
but with the feelings of a father.</p>

<p>Having remained off Alexandria for a few weeks,
Lord Keith detached us in search of our old friend
Ganteaume, but first of all taking away one of our
best ships, the <i>Hector</i> (74), and giving us in lieu the
<i>Stately</i> (64), <i>en flute</i>, a Turkish 64, and a corvette.
During our stay the captain pacha, and other Turkish
admirals, came on board on a visit of condolence to
our admiral. I recollect he was a very fine-looking
man, with a long black beard, and brought his pipe
and coffee-cup bearers with him. The mouth of the
pipe was set with diamonds, and so were his coffee-cups.
Old Tombrook, the captain of the Turkish 64,
that sailed with us, was introduced to the admiral, and
the captain pacha said that if he did not behave well,
Sir John had only to write a note to him, and his head
should be taken off immediately on his return to the
Turkish fleet; or if the admiral preferred it, he would
send an executioner on purpose to decapitate Captain
Tombrook, and lay his head at Sir John B. Warren’s
feet.</p>

<p>We left Alexandria the beginning of May, and sailed
for Coron, in the Morea, to procure wood, water, and
fresh provisions, of which we stood very much in need,
the scurvy having begun to make its appearance from
our long continuance at sea upon bad salt and other
food of the worst quality. The bread was full of maggots
and weevils, the flour musty, and swarming with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
insects, the water so putrid, thick and stinking, that
often have I held my nose with my hand while I drank
it strained through my pocket handkerchief; and we
were so short of this necessary article, that our consumption
was limited to two pints a day for all purposes.
Provisions, at the time I am speaking of, were
not like those supplied now-a-days from Her Majesty’s
stores; everything then was done by an infamous
job contract; government paid through thick and thin
for everything, and we poor devils had to suffer in
consequence of the neglect of those persons under
government winking at the nefarious jobs of contractors,
and no doubt they had weighty reasons for so
doing.</p>

<p>I recollect, in a mid’s berth, we used to ask what
such-and-such a county was famous for. Suffolk, in
our black book, was put down as famous for supplying
the navy with rotten and bad cheese. Burgoo was
served out with treacle for breakfast, instead of nice
wholesome cocoa and sugar; and will it be believed,
that until the peace of 1802, French merchants had a
contract for supplying the British Navy with French
brandy, while our West Indian merchants knew not
what to do with their rum and cocoa! At last John
Bull awoke from his dream, and it struck him that
soldiers and sailors liked rum just as well as brandy,
and that by giving them cocoa for breakfast it would
not only assist the West Indian merchants, but give
general satisfaction throughout the fleet.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of mentioning the night-blindness
which seized several of our ship’s company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
after dark. It came on immediately it began to grow
dusk. First we thought it was sham, in order to skulk
from their watches, but we soon found it was not the
case. The men were first attacked off Egypt, and it
was supposed it was occasioned by the heavy dews.
I have since been informed that it frequently occurs
in tropical climates.</p>

<p>We remained at Coron ten days, getting supplies;
but gained no intelligence of the French squadron,
though the Turkish corvette had been despatched for
that purpose, to make enquiries at the different out-ports.
On her return, we sailed for Malta, where the
Christian slaves, on board the two Turkish men-of-war,
were liberated on our arrival, to the great joy of the
Maltese. Having refitted, we proceeded to Port Mahon,
and from thence to cruise off Toulon. On our passage,
we had most severe thunder and lightning, which struck
the <i>Dragon</i> and ourselves, indeed, all the squadron
more or less; the former’s main-mast was injured, and
our mizen-top-gallant-mast was dashed to atoms, the
top-mast shaken into laths, the mizen-mast set on fire,
and the few tin and iron pots and pans, we mids had
in the gun-room, were every one perforated in the same
manner, as if a musket-ball had been fired through
them. The lightning then providentially took a direction
out of one of the gun-room ports, and escaped;
several men on board both ships were much scorched,
and one man in the <i>Dragon</i> killed. If the <i>Renown</i> had
been one of the old 74’s, whose mizen-mast stepped in
the after magazine, she must have been blown up;
but, fortunately, her’s stepped in the gun-room. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
stood on for the Gulf of Lyons, and looked into Toulon,
and there saw the French ships lying with their
prize, the <i>Swiftsure</i>, some of the ships stripped, one
with her main-mast out, and no chance of their putting
to sea again for some time. We, therefore, proceeded
to the Island of Elba, and on our way fell in with two
French frigates, and chased them into Leghorn; the
<i>Stately</i> (64), <i>en flute</i>, got pretty near them, but they
slipped through her fingers. One named the <i>Success</i>,
of 32 guns, formerly British, captured by the French
squadron, under Rear-Admiral Ganteaume, on his passage
from Brest to Toulon, a few months before, was
afterwards taken by the <i>Minerve</i> (36), Captain Cockburn,
and <i>Phœnix</i> (32), Captain Halstead, and they
drove the <i>Bravoure</i> (44) on shore near Leghorn, and
destroyed her. We then went to endeavour to relieve
the garrison of Porto Ferajo, which was closely besieged
by the French, and a sortie was agreed upon by
the garrison. The intention was to turn the enemy’s
works, and destroy his batteries, and a party of sailors
and marines were landed to assist at the attack; but
the troops from Porto Ferajo, being all foreigners, in
our pay, composed of Swiss and Germans, did not know
us nor we them. All parties met in the dark, and
hearing these people talk French, our men fired upon
them, and they upon us. The sortie never reached its
destination&mdash;Johnny Crapaud was not to be caught
napping&mdash;our expedition partly failed in its object;
Captain Long, of His Majesty’s brig <i>Vincego</i>, was killed.
“<i>Sauve qui peut</i>” was the order of the day, and a pell-mell
retreat to the boats became necessary. Followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
by the French, several were killed, wounded, and taken
prisoners, and some shot in the water, trying to swim
off to the boats. A few days after, the following
ludicrous song appeared on board, to the tune of
“Vinegar Hill”:&mdash;</p>

<p>We then returned to Minorca to get more troops;
but shortly after our arrival, a French man-of-war brig,
from Toulon, came into the roads, with despatches, to
inform us the preliminary treaty of peace had been
signed at Amiens.</p>

<p>While we remained at Minorca, we lost our captain
of marines (Burns), a very worthy man. His death was
singular. A vessel, a few weeks after the arrival of the
French brig, came from England, confirming the news
from France, with an order to cease hostilities; also
bringing letters and papers. It was one in the morning
when the news came. Poor Burns got up quite well,
and sat laughing and talking, and hearing the news
from old England, and saying what he should do when
he got upon half-pay; called for a glass of cold water,
which he drank off, and laid down in his cot again;
the cramp seized him in his stomach, and in five
minutes he was a corpse. He was much beloved in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
the ship, full of humour, and a kind-hearted pleasant
man. He was buried with military honours at Port
Mahon, all the officers of the ship, and many of the
squadron, attending his funeral.</p>

C. White<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>, a smart officer. Our worthy and amiable
admiral struck his flag at Minorca, and returned to
England, from whence he was shortly sent, at the
request of the Emperor of Russia, to St. Petersburgh, as
ambassador, and gave universal satisfaction. Indeed,
he was fully capable of wielding the sword, using the
pen, or managing the weighty matters of a court.</p>

<p>From Minorca we sailed for Malta&mdash;at which place
we remained nine months, without ever going out
of it.</p>

<p>The harbour was crowded with men-of-war, and the
garrison with troops, returned from Egypt. I heard
of a great deal of gambling taking place&mdash;some duels
in consequence, and suicides. Of all vices, gambling
is the worst, for you not only risk your own ruin, but
that of your family also; and a man of honour and
principle stands no chance with black-legs. A person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
possessed of affluence ought not to gamble, because
he cannot want another’s money, and a poor man that
does so, and plays for a large amount, must be a
swindler, knowing that if he loses he has not the
means to pay; he generally, therefore, gives leg bail
for the amount.</p>

<p>Our time passed rather heavily during this long
sojourn in one place. We used, however, to go occasionally
in a boat to St. Paul’s Bay, and have a ride to
Florean to see the catacombs, and to Cività Vecchia
to view the handsome church of St. Paul.</p>

<p>A malignant fever broke out in several of the ships,
owing, probably, to the great heat of the weather,
when many died: it was something like the yellow
fever, and came on in August and September.</p>

<p>Shortly after this we embarked two companies of
artillery, under a Captain McDonald, and Lieutenants
Dougal, Campbell, and Carmichael, with orders to proceed
to Gibraltar, and thence home. Owing to heavy
westerly winds, we had a six weeks’ passage, and found
on our arrival that a most serious disturbance had
taken place amongst the troops in the garrison, which
ended in one of the regiments being packed off to the
West Indies. Various causes were assigned for the
mutiny, and amongst others, a too sudden change
from a very relaxed state of discipline to the opposite
extreme.</p>

<p>After remaining here a few days, though we had
expected to sail the moment the wind came to the
eastward for England, the arrival of despatches from
thence stopped our proceeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Napoleon’s plans, by the wisdom and foresight of
the Ministry, were seen through, and orders arrived
for the detention of all the ships of the line (at all serviceable)
then in the Mediterranean, instead of sending
them to England. This created a partial murmur
amongst the different crews; but the firmness and strict
discipline of our captain and officers kept our ship’s
company perfectly quiet. The crew of the <i>Gibraltar</i>,
however, broke out, and two of the unfortunate men
were hanged afterwards in Orestana Bay, Sardinia.</p>

<p>We sailed from the Rock in September, 1802, for
Orestana Bay, in company with the <i>Dragon</i> (74) and
<i>Gibraltar</i> (80), and there joined Rear-Admiral Sir
R. Bickerton’s squadron. On our way an accident
occurred, which very nearly sent us back to the Rock
a cripple. In the act of wearing, we ran on board of
the old <i>Gibraltar</i>. Fortunately, it was fine weather,
as we took her nearly amidships, carried away part
of our cutwater and jib-boom, but did her no damage.
It was our fault. The signal was made to wear together.
We were to windward. The <i>Renown</i> answered her
helm in a moment. Not so the old <i>Gibraltar</i>, she took
longer time, and before she could get out of our way
we were on board of her.</p>

<p>Our time (nearly nine weeks) passed dull enough at
this anchorage. Occasionally we went shooting and
fishing. Fish, however, were scarce&mdash;although, had we
taken the right method, more perhaps might have been
caught. Plenty of those beautiful large mussels, whose
shells are nearly two feet long, were to be found quite
at the head of the bay in the shallows; also mullet and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
rock fish; and on the different shores various kinds of
plover, and other wild fowl. But small shot was so
scarce in the squadron, that the feathered tribe were
not so much diminished as they might have been. I
recollect one of the lieutenants, named Jane (now a
captain), used to employ me to roll slugs between
pieces of wood to convert them into a kind of round-shot,
for which service he generally took me with him
on his shooting excursions. The inhabitants of these
parts are a wild race of beings, and mostly clothed in
black sheep skins, the wool outside.</p>

<p>We left Sardinia in November, and proceeded to
Malta for the winter, and on the 18th of May, 1803,
put to sea with the squadron, under Sir R. Bickerton,
Bart., to cruise off Naples, matters having assumed an
hostile appearance at home.</p>

<p>After sailing through the Faro of Messina, when
passing near the island of Stromboli, its volcano
broke out in a most beautiful eruption, which lasted
for several months. We had the good fortune to be
becalmed pretty near it for a whole night, which gave
us a magnificent illumination, and at intervals a cloud
of fireworks, thrown from its crater into the air, sent
forth a brilliant light. Having been off deck in my
watch, and my quarter and station bills not being
correct and kept in good order, I had four hours of sky-parlour
on the main-royal-cross-trees, which enabled
me to have a fine view of the burning mountain, and of
its river of fire, which appeared to run from its crater
into the sea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="summary">From the commencement of second Gallic War until the Battle of
Trafalgar, 1805; with Anecdotes.</p>

<p class="p2">Whilst off Naples official notice reached us of the
declaration of war against France, and we proceeded
immediately off Toulon, where, in the course of a short
time, Lord Nelson arrived in a frigate, and took the
command of the fleet in the Mediterranean. His lordship’s
flagship (the <i>Victory</i>) joined us in a few weeks,
having on her passage out captured a French frigate,
and some merchant vessels. We continued to cruise
in the Gulf of Lyons from June, 1803, until the 24th of
July, 1804, without ever going into any port to refit.
It is true that occasionally the whole fleet ran from
the heavy gales of the Gulf of Lyons, and took shelter
in various outlandish places in Sardinia, where we could
get wood and water, such as at Agincourt Sound&mdash;amongst
the Magdalen islands&mdash;in the Straits of Bonifacio
(a most beautiful anchorage, sheltered from all
winds); but the shores and country around are the
picture of desolation&mdash;no town&mdash;no trees of any size&mdash;rocks
upon rocks, and the stunted bushes of the wild
myrtle and arbutus merely sufficient for the purposes
of fuel. There was a small village seven or eight miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
off, at one of the Magdalen islands, where some few got
their linen washed, but most of us in the fleet were put
to our shifts to get that necessary comfort (clean linen)
accomplished.</p>

<p>These long cruises used to put our wits sadly to the
test for an appearance of a bit of white linen above our
black cravats, particularly when we had to answer the
signal for a midshipman on board the flagship.</p>

<p>Soap was almost&mdash;indeed, I might say, quite&mdash;as
scarce an article as clean shirts and stockings. It was
a common thing in those days of real hard service to
turn shirts and stockings inside out, and make them do
a little more duty. Sometimes we used to search the
clothes-bag to see “if one good turn deserved another.”
These expedients, added to reefed stockings, made us
appear sufficiently dandified to go and answer the
signal. Borrowing those articles that had been washed
on shore&mdash;if such a thing was left amongst one of us&mdash;was
quite out of the question, for we knew the day of
repayment was very far off.</p>

<p>The island of Sardinia affords several good anchorages
for fleets and squadrons in particular winds:
Orestana Bay, St. Peter, St. Antonio, Cagliari, from the
south-west to the south side, and Terra Nova Bay on
the north-east; besides many others for single or few
ships. Porto Conti, for instance, on the north-west part
of the island, is a very safe one. Our noble and gallant
chief used to manage to get us fresh beef twice a week&mdash;that
is to say, so many live bullocks were embarked
on board each ship, and we killed them as we wanted
them&mdash;by which means, with the assistance of oranges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
that were procured occasionally, few cases of scurvy
occurred in the fleet, notwithstanding our long stay at
sea. But as for articles of luxury&mdash;tea, potatoes, soap,
and other sea stores for our messes&mdash;we had none.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Sardinia were as wild as their
country; the mountaineers and lowlanders generally
were engaged in a kind of petty war with each other.
Both parties always went armed, and murders frequently
took place. At one of the anchorages in the
straits, another mid and myself were attending a watering
party&mdash;one of these fellows rode down with a bag
of cheese, made of goat’s or sheep’s milk, for sale; he
was armed with a long gun and pistols, and we had no
firearms with us. Some dispute in the bargaining, for
the want of understanding each other’s language, arose;
the Sard, very coolly mounted his horse, and taking
up his cheeses, rode off a short distance, and fired at
us; the ball passed through the sleeve of the mate’s
coat, and near my head; he then galloped off, reloaded
his gun, rode up, and gave us another shot, but
luckily without injury.</p>

<p>A midshipman of the <i>Victory</i> was killed by these
fellows a short time afterwards in consequence of some
dispute about the hiring of a horse that had been
brought down by these wild folks to the beach. The
poor mid, anxious for a ride, gave the rascal a dollar,
mounted the horse, and rode backwards and forwards
for an hour on or near the beach. The Sardinian
wanted his horse, the other thought he had not had
his dollar’s worth of riding, and a warm dispute ensuing,
the Sard most deliberately shot at him with his gun,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
and broke his arm, so close up that it was necessary to
take it out of the socket. He bore the operation well,
poor fellow, but a fever afterwards came on, which
carried him off. Lord Nelson tried to get satisfaction,
but in a wild country like this, without law or justice,
it was found impossible. The offender made his escape
to the mountains, and nothing further was heard of
him.</p>

<p>Shooting parties occasionally took place, but, not
having dogs, the sportsmen were seldom rewarded.
Although some kinds of game were numerous, and
flocks of blue pigeons, to the amount of thousands
together, were seen, few were brought on board, for no
person dared follow them far for fear of the wind
changing, when we knew the fleet would sail immediately
to regain our station. Previous to the Spanish
war we were sent by his lordship, in the <i>Renown</i>, to the
Bay of Rosas, in Catalonia, to procure bullocks and
oranges for the fleet, where we remained long enough
to have our clothes washed&mdash;a luxury we stood much
in need of.</p>

<p>Our long cruise of near fourteen months off Toulon,
amidst nothing but gales of wind, and heavy storms of
most terrific thunder and lightning, met with no reward
in the shape of prize-money.</p>

<p>One man-of-war schooner, of 12 guns, called the
<i>Renard</i>, and half-a-dozen small French vessels, were
the only captures made by the fleet during the above
period; these, with the exception of the schooner, not
being worth sending into port, were destroyed. A
lieutenant of the <i>Renown</i>, and myself, went to Malta<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
in the <i>Renard</i>, and shortly after rejoined our ship off
Toulon, in the <i>Narcissus</i> frigate.</p>

<p>One of the marine officers had a monkey on board,
who used to amuse us with his gambols; but was rather
fond of biting, for which he received occasionally a
beating from us youngsters. This brought on a coolness
between his master and us, and led at last to
open war.</p>

<p>A cabal was formed to get Jacko a licking from his
own master, by letting him loose from his chain in the
marine officer’s cabin, that he might do some mischief;
and the time chosen was when his best clothes were
put out ready for him to dine with the captain.</p>

<p>We knew F. was invited that day, because we had
seen the captain’s steward ask him, and his own servant
go into the marine officer’s berth (he had one in the
gun-room, on the lower-deck, where we messed), and
lay out his best coat, epaulet, white trousers, etc.;
and after making all other preparations necessary for
the toilet, leave the cabin, lock the door, put the key
in his pocket, and go away.</p>

<p>Now was the time for action. A mid of the name
of O., the leader of all mischief, undertook to get into
the cabin through the lower-deck port, by going on
deck, then into the mizen chains, and from thence by
a rope’s end made fast under his arms. We let him
down through the port on the lower-deck into the cabin,
and he untied the monkey. This being done, we returned
into the gun-room, and peeped through the
key-hole and cracks to see Jacko’s manœuvres.</p>

<p>After jumping about and chattering to himself for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
some little time, he commenced operations. Unfortunately
for his owner, he found a bottle of ink, which
he let fall, and it broke in pieces, splashing the ink on
the deck. The monkey was now in his glory; he
seized upon the new red coat and epaulet, and began
mopping up the wet, then chattering to himself, jumping
about and appearing to feel quite delighted with
his performance, particularly when he saw the marks
of his hands and feet, stained with black, upon the red
uniform. Not contented with his exploits on the coat,
he lugged down the pair of smart inexpressibles, that
looked so temptingly white, hanging over the chair,
and finished the housemaid’s work by wiping up the
remainder of the ink with them. This feat having been
done, we thought we had seen enough, and went most
innocently to give information to the lieutenant of
Marines, and his servant, that Jacko was loose in the
cabin, and, we were afraid, was after some mischief, for
we heard something break, and by peeping through the
key-hole, saw he had his master’s coat on the deck,
and dragging it about.</p>

<p>Down ran the poor marine officer, calling his servant
to bring the key. The moment the door was opened,
the first glance showed the havoc committed on the
dinner dress. Jacko, perceiving his frolic was over, retreated
into his cage, from whence he was dragged to
get a good beating. The poor servant was scolded because
the monkey had got loose, who very truly said
it was tied up safe when he left the cabin. The officer
swore, stamped, and raved like a madman. His dress
was so completely messed for the day, he could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
dine with the captain; and we innocent young rascals
stood looking very demure, and condoling with him on
his misfortune, all the time laughing in our sleeves at
the trick we had played. We had paid off the master
and monkey, who between the two had got us sent to
the mast-head occasionally for being saucy to the
marine officer, because we did not like being bitten,
without licking Jacko for it.</p>

<p>A reward was offered to find out who let it loose,
that F. might make the person or persons pay the
damage; but it was never found out, and on the earliest
opportunity the monkey was sent out of the ship, on
board a merchant vessel we fell in with, bound to
Malta, his master having had quite enough of monkey
tricks.</p>

<p>A ship of the line, the <i>Kent</i> (74), Captain Pulteney
Malcolm, having been kept in the Bay of Naples to
attend the royal family there, in case of their being
obliged to go to Palermo, to avoid falling into the
hands of the French, the <i>Renown</i> was sent to relieve
her. The <i>Kent</i> was ordered home in consequence of
being leaky, and very much out of repair. Captain
J. C. White wishing to return home, exchanged into
the <i>Kent</i> with Captain Pulteney Malcolm; he took
several of the midshipmen with him, and myself amongst
the number. We remained ten days at Naples, which
were employed by the captain in seeing everything
worth observation, and he was so kind as to take
another youngster and myself with him.</p>

<p>After the above period, we left Naples for the Bay
of Salerno, at which place we embarked a large supply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
of cattle and vegetables for our fleet off Toulon. On
joining them, we found our ship very weak, and her
timbers, from the looseness of several bolts, working
very much, and causing her to make a good deal of
water,&mdash;in fine weather from six to eight inches per
hour, and in bad weather two feet, which kept
increasing to nearly four,&mdash;until our arrival in England.</p>

<p>After having given the bullocks to the ships, we
proceeded to Gibraltar, and from thence to Cadiz,
where we took on board a million and sixty thousand
dollars. We anchored near a handsome French seventy-four
and frigate; the former, called <i>L’Aigle</i>, the name
of the other I forget. Whenever we passed near them,
some of their crew would abuse us; we told them to
come outside, and see how soon we would take the
change out of them; but they stood too much in awe
of a British seventy-four, although we had such a
tempting cargo to urge them to the risk.</p>

<p>At this period, four of our frigates, under Sir Graham
Moore, were cruising off Cape St. Vincent to intercept
the four Spanish frigates, loaded with treasure, expected
home. We spoke our ships off there, and a few
days afterwards they fell in with the Spaniards, took
three, and the unfortunate fourth blew up in the action
with all her crew.</p>

<p>I always did think, and my opinion has never
changed, that it was a cruel thing to send only four
frigates to detain four others, when by increasing the
force by two or three line-of-battle ships, this might
have been effected without loss of blood, or honour to
the Spaniards. If it was necessary to detain these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
vessels and treasure from political motives, in order to
make the king of Spain declare his equivocal conduct,
it would have been humane to have sent such a force
as would have put resistance out of the question; for
what man, who was not a traitor, could yield without
fighting (and with such a valuable cargo on board), to
a force, in all appearance, not greater than his own.
It was an untoward event. After a long passage, we
at length arrived at Spithead, the ship in a very leaky,
weak state. Having landed the money, we left Portsmouth
the end of October for Chatham, at which place
the ship was paid off.</p>

<p>Our old parson was a “rum” subject; after trying
all other mess places, he got old Pipes, the boatswain,
to take him into his. They agreed very well for a
little time; but one unfortunate day, the evil genius
of poor old Fritz prevailed, for Pipes coming down
rather unexpectedly to his cabin in the fore cock-pit
to get a glass of grog, having got wet when the hands
were turned up reefing topsails, he found the parson
helping himself rather too freely out of his liquor-case.
This was a crime Mr. Boatswain could not put up with.
A breach immediately ensued, and an instant dismissal
from his berth took place, with the exclamation of,
“The parson is such a black; I cannot allow him to
mess with me any longer.” After this occurrence, the
captain interfered, and he again messed in his proper
place with the officers in the wardroom. And I recollect
one Sunday morning before church-time, the old
fellow came into our berth, and with his hand to his
stomach, began: “Oh! my dear fellow, I feel so poorly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
I do not know what to do, or how I shall get through
the service.” “What is the matter, Mr. F.?” I enquired.
“Oh! I feel such a pain.” I knew what he wanted, so
I went to the locker, took out the rum bottle, and gave
a good boatswain’s glass of grog (three parts spirits,
and one water). He told me I had saved his life, and
that now he could preach very well. “Come, sir,” said
I, “take a north-wester to wash the other down,” which
he did. The service commenced soon after, and he
performed it admirably.</p>

<p>He was a clever, facetious, and kind-hearted person;
and I believe it was money matters that drove him,
poor man! to the bottle; he died sometime after on
shore. He used to tell us boys: “My dear fellows,
do as I say, and not as I do.”</p>

<p>Not having been in England for four years, and my
brother being encamped on Coxheath, I got permission,
previous to the ship being paid off, to go and see him.
Nothing would serve me but a ride on horseback.
I was dressed out very smart in white visibles&mdash;not
invisibles, as the ladies call them&mdash;although it appears
the fashion of the day to show they wear trousers,
<i>whose scientific, Oriental name, by-the-bye, is fatimas</i>.
To the young ladies I have a pretty little anecdote to
relate. I knew a very gallant officer who fell deeply
in love with a lady merely from handing her into a
carriage. The moment she put her pretty feet upon
the carriage steps he was pierced by Cupid’s arrows.
He dreamed of them all night; thought of them when
he awoke in the morning; he could not drive them
from his imagination during the day. The pretty feet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
again appeared before his fancy when asleep the next
night, and the third day found him prostrate before
them, acknowledging their beauty, and supplicating
that he might call them his own. He was accepted.
Were this not an “olla”&mdash;which means in Spanish
something of all sorts&mdash;I should not have ventured to
have written the above.</p>

<p>To return to my ride. As I said before, I was in
full dress, with cocked hat, long coat, and side-arms,
that I might appear in camp in a becoming manner.
The landlord at the inn told me he knew sailors liked
to ride fast, and promised to give me a quiet blood
mare he had in his stables, who would show me the
way. She was shortly equipped, and brought out.
Upon her back I mounted; but scarcely were we out
of the town of Chatham when off she started at full
speed, and ran away with me along the turnpike road,
to the amusement of some of his Majesty’s liege subjects,
and to the terror and dismay of others&mdash;up hill,
down dale, splashing myself, and every person I met,
with mud, for the roads were wet, and it began to pour
with rain. The ladies and gentlemen in their carriages
as I passed them stared at me with astonishment.
Having got to a place, called Kit’s Cot Hill, I ran on
board of a man riding upon a donkey, with two sacks
of flour, knocking him, donkey and cargo, head over
heels; but my steed being pretty nearly blown, I at
length stopped her.</p>

<p>The miller was, fortunately, not hurt, but came up
in a great passion to attack me. Luckily just at the
moment some soldiers, who belonged to the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
regiment as my brother, were passing by: they took
my part, and, a parley ensuing, I explained how the
untoward event had happened, and it ended in a laugh.
Not far from this was a small inn, where I put up my
flyaway, having had enough riding for one day, hired a
gig, and at last got safe to the regiment without any
broken bones.</p>

<p>Shortly after this the ship was paid off, and I joined
the <i>Barfleur</i> (98), having had six weeks’ leave to see
my friends and relate the wonders of my four years’
voyage in foreign parts.</p>

<p>Throughout the four months I passed in the <i>Barfleur</i>
we were attached to the channel fleet.</p>

<p>In May, 1805, I removed to the <i>Neptune</i> (98 guns),
Captain T. F. Fremantle, a clever, brave, and smart
officer, who sent me home to pass my examination at
Somerset House, in August, which I did, before old
Captain Sir Alexander Snap Hammond, whose character
for turning mids back frightened me not a little.
The one examined before me not having been sent, as
from Oxford or Cambridge, to rusticate in green fields
and sylvan groves, but condemned to study six months
longer in a mid’s berth on the briny element in order
to finish his nautical education, and eat peas-pudding,
burgoo and molasses, salt-junk, lobscouse, sea-pie, and
study Hamilton Moore. However, the passing captains,
seeing I was alarmed on first entering, civilly
desired me to be seated a few minutes and take courage.
Having waited a short time, and got rather better of
some odd qualms and palpitations which the unfortunate
candidate turned back before me had created,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
I was ordered to find the time of high-water at Plymouth,
work an azimuth amplitude, double altitude,
bearings and distances, &amp;c., which being performed, I
was desired to stand up, and consider myself on the
quarter-deck of a man-of-war at Spithead&mdash;“unmoor”&mdash;“get
underway”&mdash;“stand out to sea”&mdash;“make
and shorten sail”&mdash;“reef”&mdash;“return into port”&mdash;“unrig
the foremast and bowsprit, and rig them again.”
I got into a scrape after reefing for not overhauling
the reef tackles when hoisting the sails. However,
they passed me, and desired me to come again the
next day to receive my passing certificate. I made
the captains the best bow I could, and, without staying
to look behind me, bolted out of the room, and was
surrounded in a moment by other poor fellows, who
were anxiously waiting their turn to be called in for
examination, who asked what questions had been put
to me, and the answers I made, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This important event over, I spent a few days of
September with my friends; then repaired to Plymouth,
and was ordered a passage to join the <i>Neptune</i>
(98), off Cadiz, in the <i>Belleisle</i> (74), one of the very
last ships that sailed to join the fleet of Lord Nelson.</p>

<p>We had a very quick run out, and ten days before
the ever-memorable and glorious 21st of October,
1805, I rejoined my ship.</p>

<p class="p2">I shall never forget the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st
of October, 1805. Signs of a movement in the combined
fleets of France and Spain in Cadiz were made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
by signal on the 18th by the inshore squadron, and on
the 19th the enemy came out of port. The wind was
light and the day rather hazy, so that the body of our
fleet never perceived them. Sunday we had a fresh
breeze, when some of the headmost ships saw the
enemy in shore, but they were too close under the
land to be attacked. All hearts towards evening beat
with joyful anxiety for the next day, which we hoped
would crown our anxious blockade labours with a successful
battle. When night closed in, the rockets and
blue lights, with signal guns, informed us the inshore
squadron still kept sight of our foes, and, like good
and watchful dogs, our ships continued to send forth
occasionally a growling cannon to keep us on the
alert, and to cheer us with the hope of a glorious day
on the morrow.</p>

<p>And the morrow came; and with it the sun rose,
which, as it ascended from its bed of ocean, looked
hazy and watery, as if it smiled in tears on many
brave hearts which fate had decreed should never see
it set. It was my morning watch; I was midshipman
of the forecastle, and at the first dawn of day a forest
of strange masts was seen to leeward. I ran aft and
informed the officer of the watch. The captain was
on deck in a moment, and ere it was well light, the
signals were flying through the fleet to bear up and
form the order of sailing in two columns.</p>

<p>The wind had moderated considerably in the night,
but still our fleet, which consisted of twenty-seven sail
of the line, four frigates, a schooner, and cutter, was
much scattered. Our ship had been previously pre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>pared
for battle, so that with the exception of stowing
hammocks, slinging the lower yards, stoppering the
topsail-sheets, and other minor matters, little remained
to be done. All sail was set, and the different ships
tried to form the line in two divisions, but the lightness
of the wind, and the distance of the sternmost
from the van, prevented anything like speed in the
manœuvre; in short, the line never was properly
formed, for the brave and gallant chiefs of each division
were too eager to get into battle to wait for this.
The old <i>Neptune</i>, which never was a good sailer, took
it into her head to sail better that morning than I
ever remember to have seen her do before. About
ten o’clock we got close to the <i>Victory</i>, and Captain
Fremantle had intended to pass her and break the
enemy’s line, but poor Lord Nelson himself hailed us
from the stern-walk of the <i>Victory</i>, and said, “<i>Neptune</i>,
take in your studding-sails and drop astern; I shall
break the line myself.” A signal was then made for
the <i>Téméraire</i> (98) to take her station between us and
the <i>Victory</i>, which consequently made us the third
ship in the van of his lordship’s column.</p>

<p>At this period the enemy were forming their double
line in the shape of a crescent. It was a beautiful
sight when their line was completed: their broadsides
turned towards us, showing their iron teeth, and now
and then trying the range of a shot to ascertain the
distance, that they might, the moment we came within
point blank (about six hundred yards), open their fire
upon our van ships&mdash;no doubt with the hope of dismasting
some of our leading vessels before they could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
close and break their line. Some of them were
painted like ourselves&mdash;with double yellow sides;
some with a broad single red or yellow streak; others
all black; and the noble <i>Santissima Trinidada</i> (138),
with four distinct lines of red, with a white ribbon
between them, made her seem to be a superb man-of-war,
which indeed she was. Her appearance was
imposing; her head splendidly ornamented with a
colossal group of figures, painted white, representing
the Holy Trinity, from which she took her name.
This magnificent ship was destined to be our opponent.
She was lying-to under topsails, top-gallant
sails, royals, jib, and spanker; her courses were hauled
up; and her lofty, towering sails looked beautiful,
peering through the smoke, as she awaited the onset.
The flags of France and Spain, both handsome,
chequered the line, waving defiance to that of Britain.</p>

<p>Then, in our fleet, union-jacks and ensigns were
made fast to the fore and fore-topmast-stays, as well
as to the mizen-rigging, besides one at the peak, in
order that we might not mistake each other in the
smoke, and to show the enemy our determination to
conquer. Towards eleven, our two lines were better
formed, but still there existed long gaps in Vice-Admiral
Collingwood’s division. Lord Nelson’s van
was strong: three three-deckers (<i>Victory</i>, <i>Téméraire</i>,
and <i>Neptune</i>), and four seventy-four’s, their jib-booms
nearly over the others’ taffrails, the bands playing “God
save the King,” “Rule Britannia,” and “Britons strike
home;” the crews stationed on the forecastle of the different
ships, cheering the ship ahead of them when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
enemy began to fire, sent those feelings to our hearts
that ensured us victory. About ten minutes before
twelve, our antagonists opened their fire upon the
<i>Royal Sovereign</i> (110), Vice-Admiral Collingwood,
who most nobly, and unsupported for at least ten
minutes, led his division into action, steering for the
<i>Santa Anna</i> (112), which was painted all black, bearing
the flag of Admiral Gravina, during which time
all the enemy’s line that could possibly bring a gun
to bear were firing at her. She was the admiration
of the whole fleet.</p>

<p>To show the great and master mind of Nelson, who
was thinking of everything even in the momentous
hour of battle, when most minds would have been
totally absorbed in other matters, it was remarked by
him that the enemy had the iron hoops round their
masts painted black; orders were issued by signal to
whitewash those of his fleet, that in the event of all
the ensigns being shot away, his ships might be distinguished
by their white masts and hoops.</p>

<p>In order to convey a more accurate notion of the
commencement and of the ensuing events of this
glorious day, I shall introduce an extract from the
log-book of His Majesty’s Ship <i>Neptune</i> (98 guns):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, moderate and fine weather; at daylight discovered 39 strange
ships to leeward. At 6, answered the signal from the <i>Victory</i>, Lord
Nelson’s flag-ship, No. 76, to form the order of sailing in two lines;
bore up and made all sail, the fleet consisting of twenty-seven ships of
the line, four frigates, a cutter, and schooner, in company; cleared ship
for action. At 11, answered the general telegraph signal, ‘England
expects every man will do his duty’; Captain Fremantle inspected the
different decks, and made known the above signal, which was received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
with cheers. At 11.30, the signal to break the enemy’s line, and
engage to leeward.</p>

<p>“At 12, the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> (110), Vice-Admiral Collingwood,
most nobly broke the enemy’s line, and engaged the Spanish Admiral
Gravina, whose flag was flying in the <i>Santa Anna</i> (112), cutting off the
19th ship from their rear; the French and Spanish fleet, of 33 sail of
the line, 4 frigates, and 2 brigs, lying-to for us to leeward, with their
heads to the northward.</p>

<p>“At 12.15, the <i>Victory</i> (100), Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson, followed
by the <i>Téméraire</i> (98), Captain Eliab Hervey, and <i>Neptune</i> (98), Captain
Fremantle, broke the line of the enemy by the French Commander-in-Chief’s
ship, Admiral Villeneuve, in the <i>Bucentaure</i> (84), and
<i>Santissima Trinidada</i> (138), of four decks, bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral
Don Cisneros Baltazar, the eleventh ship from the van.</p>

<p>“At 12.25, three of the enemy’s ships of the line opened their fire
upon us, raking us fore and aft. At 12.35, we broke their line, passed
between, and opened our broadside and raked them on both sides. At
12.47, we engaged a two-deck ship, with a flag at her mizen. At 1.30,
entirely dismasted her, she struck her colours; but before that, the
<i>Leviathan</i> (74), also opened her broadside upon her, we passed on (first
giving her three hearty cheers), and bore down and attacked the <i>Santissima
Trinidada</i>, a Spanish four-decker of 140 guns, with a flag at
her mizen; raked her as we passed under her stern; and at 1.50 opened
our fire on her starboard quarter. At 2.40, shot away her main and
mizen masts; at 2.50, her foremast; at 3, she cried for quarter, and
hailed us to say they had surrendered; she then stuck English colours
to the stump of her mainmast; gave her three cheers. At this time the
<i>Leviathan</i> and <i>Conqueror</i> (74’s), on our starboard quarter, firing on some
of the enemy’s ships. Our standing and running rigging much cut;
foretop-gallant and royal-yard shot away; the foremast and foretop-mast
very badly wounded; three shot in the main-mast; one cheek of the
mizen mast shot away, and wounded in other places; foreyard nearly
shot in two, and ship pulled in several places; sent down men to get
up more shot, having nearly fired away all that was on deck.</p>

<p>“When the smoke cleared away, observed the <i>Victory</i>, <i>Royal
Sovereign</i>, and <i>Téméraire</i> warmly engaged, and the six van ships of the
enemy who had not been engaged had tacked, and were bearing down
to attack us. At 3.30, opened our fire on them, assisted by the
<i>Leviathan</i> and <i>Conqueror</i>; observed one of them to have all her masts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
shot away by our united fire; the rest then hauled their wind (we
learned afterwards it was Rear-Admiral Dumanoir), and making off to
the southward, and we not in a condition to follow them, our sails
being nearly shot from the yards, and, in addition to other defects, not
a brace or bowline left. Turned the hands up to knot and splice, and
bend new sails. At 5, observed 18 sail of the enemy making off, viz.,
13 sail of the line, 3 frigates, and 2 brigs, leaving to us 20 ships of the
line, 2 of which were first-rates, viz., <i>Santissima Trinidada</i> and <i>Santa
Anna</i>. At 5.15, a French ship of the line, <i>L’Achille</i>, blew up with
nearly all her crew. Observed the <i>Victory</i> with her mizen-mast and all
her topmasts shot away; the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> with only her foremast
standing; unable to see the condition of the rest of the fleet. At 6,
we hailed the <i>Ajax</i> (74), and told her to go and take possession of a
French ship of the line dismasted; saw the <i>Prince</i> (98) take the <i>Santissima
Trinidada</i> (138) in tow, which had struck to us. Found we had
10 men killed, and 35 wounded, 4 of whom shortly after died of their
wounds.</p>

<p>“At midnight, having repaired what damages we could, made sail.
At 4 in the morning of the 22nd, we were spoke by the <i>Pickle</i> schooner,
who told us it was Admiral Collingwood’s orders. We took some ship
in tow. At daylight, observed Admiral C.’s flag in the <i>Euryalus</i>
frigate, with the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> in tow, who made our signal to take
her in tow, which we did.</p>

<p>“At daylight, it blew a fresh gale from the S.S.W.; the ships very
much scattered; all the prizes dismasted and drifting about, most of
them having been cast off from the ships that had them in tow; and
the French 84-gun ship, <i>Rédoutable</i>, while in tow of the British <i>Swiftsure</i>,
foundered with nearly all her unfortunate crew. At daylight of
the 23rd, we picked up four of her people floating upon a piece of her
wreck. Came on board of us, as prisoner from the <i>Mars</i> (74), Admiral
Villeneuve, the French commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>“In this battle we lost the brave Vice-Admiral Viscount Nelson,
who was killed on board the <i>Victory</i> by a musket-ball from the maintop
of the French 84-gun ship, <i>Rédoutable</i>. The news of the death of
this lamented hero threw a damp over our victory, which we were not
prepared for. At noon on the 23rd, the signal was made that the
remnant of the enemy’s fleet was coming out of Cadiz to try and
pick up some of the dismasted ships and prizes; cast off the <i>Royal
Sovereign</i>, and bore up with the rest of the ships that were able, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
formed the line of battle to leeward of our dismasted ships and prizes
for their protection; on seeing which, the enemy returned into port
without accomplishing his object, but losing another ship, the <i>El Rayo</i>
(100), for his pains!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus ended this noble fight, the consequences of
which were felt from one end of Europe to the other,
indeed, I may say, in all parts of the world; and,
surely, for such a day’s work, the country ought to
have voted a medal, not only to the admirals and
captains, but (as was the case at Waterloo) to every
officer, seaman, and marine, in the fleet.</p>

<p>The loss of the <i>Neptune</i> in this action, considering
what she did, was comparatively small; but the ship
was admirably managed by her gallant captain, who
was ably supported by a clever scientific first lieutenant
(the present Captain George Acklom), who
justly merited every praise for his coolness and abilities
on that memorable day.</p>

<p>During the time we were going into action, and
being raked by the enemy, the whole of the crew, with
the exception of the officers, were made to lie flat on
the deck, to secure them from the raking shots, some
of which came in at the bows and went out at the
stern. Had it not been for the above precaution, many
lives must have been sacrificed. My quarters were
the five midship-guns on each side of the main-deck.
I was sent on board the <i>Santissima Trinidada</i>, a few
days after the action, to assist in getting out the
wounded men, previous to destroying her. She was a
magnificent ship, and ought now to be in Portsmouth
harbour. Her top-sides, it is true, were perfectly rid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>dled
by our beautiful firing, and she had, if I recollect
right, 550 killed and wounded; but from the lower
part of the sills of the lower-deck ports to the water’s
edge, few shot of consequence had hurt her between
wind and water, and those were all plugged up. She
was built of cedar, and would have lasted for ages,
a glorious trophy of the battle; but “sink, burn, and
destroy,” was the order of the day, and after a great
deal of trouble, scuttling her in many places, hauling
up her lower-deck ports,&mdash;that when she rolled the
heavy sea might fill her decks,&mdash;she did at last go
unwillingly to the bottom.</p>

<p>I have now by me a gilt dirk that I brought away
from her, it belonged to the Spanish admiral’s son,
Don Baltazar Cisneros; I would not part with it for
its weight in gold. Of all our hard-earned prizes, only
four got safe to Gibraltar; viz., <i>San Ildefonso</i> (74),
<i>San Juan Nepomuceno</i> (74), <i>Bahama</i> (74), and the old
English <i>Swiftsure</i> (74), the rest were either sunk or
burnt. Nothing being talked of now but horizontal
firing, it is to be hoped we shall fire as well and with
the same precision and effect next war, as the British
fleet did on this memorable day.</p>

<p>The establishment of the school for naval gunnery
on board the <i>Excellent</i> at Portsmouth, placed as it is
under the superintendence of Sir Thomas Hastings,
and other scientific officers, will, in my humble opinion
however some persons may affect to despise teaching
seamen the science of naval gunnery, be of general
benefit to the service. One of the originators of it, the
gallant Captain Sir John Pechell, Bart., C.B., K.C.B.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
deserves great credit, and the thanks of the service for
the interest, zeal, and attention he has paid to it; as
also does Captain George Smith, who invented the
moveable target, now used on board our men-of-war,
and several other ingenious and clever inventions
of his have been before the public. He has lately
invented paddle-box life boats for steam ships.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lord Nelson’s Death and Triumph.</span></h3>

<p class="center"><i>From the Sheffield Paper, 1805.</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Intelligence of a most glorious event, accompanied with tidings of
an awful calamity (like the angels of mercy and affliction travelling together),
has arrived on our shores, and awakened the public mind from
the agony of despondence to a tumult of mingled emotions, sorrow and
joy, mourning and triumph.</p>

<p>“On the 21st of October, 1805, while the cowardly and incapable
Austrian, General Mack, was surrendering himself and army into the
hands of Bonaparte, the noble and lamented Lord Nelson, once more,
and for the last time, fought and conquered the united foes of his
country; but he fell in the meridian of victory, and in one moment
became immortal in both worlds.</p>

<p>“His career of services had been long; but it was only in the last
war that he burst upon the eye of the public as a luminary of the first
magnitude. At the battle of Aboukir, he rose like the sun in the east,
and like the sun too, after a summer’s day of glory, he set in the west,
at the battle of Trafalgar, leaving the ocean in a blaze as he went down,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
and in darkness when he descended.</p>

<p>“In ages to come, when the stranger who visits our island shall
enquire for the monument of Nelson, the answer will be, ‘Behold his
country which he has saved.’”</p></blockquote>

<p class="summary">Join the <i>Melpomene</i> (38)&mdash;Sent up the Mediterranean&mdash;Tremendous
weather, with thunder, lightning, and water-spouts&mdash;Ship loses her rudder
and main-topmast&mdash;Proceed to Malta.</p>

<p class="p2">Ten days after the action, I was appointed acting
lieutenant of the <i>Melpomene</i> (38), Captain Peter Parker.
The weather having moderated, we sailed in company
with the <i>Orion</i> (74), Captain Codrington: <i>Endymion</i>
(44), and <i>Weazle</i> brig, (18); to look into Toulon, and
scour the Mediterranean, in search of a squadron of
French frigates. We parted from the fleet on the 8th
of November, 1805, with every prospect of a most
delightful cruise, and the chance of picking up some
prizes; but a few days after leaving Gibraltar, our
golden hopes were dashed to nought, and we were
sent a wreck, without a rudder, to Malta.</p>

<p>The weather continued moderate until the 11th,
when we captured a small Spanish settee, laden with
stores of little value, and took her in tow, for the
purpose of conveying her to the commodore, but a
heavy squall coming on, we destroyed her.</p>

<p>On the 12th, we saw the island of Majorca, and
finding the main-yard sprung, we lowered it down,
and fished it. On the 13th, owing to the violence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
the gale and heavy sea, we bore up, with the <i>Weazle</i>
brig in company, to take shelter under Majorca; at
this time the ship was labouring very hard, in consequence
of a heavy cross swell. On the 14th, none of
the squadron were in sight; the morning of the 15th,
about nine o’clock, a most tremendous squall came on,
accompanied with thunder, lightning, rain, and sleet,
which obliged us to clew up all our sails; shortly
afterwards the main-mast was struck by lightning, the
fluid exploded by the pumps, and knocked myself
and a seaman down; the sensation I felt was that of
a severe electric shock, shaking every bone in my
body, but, thank God! it did me no further injury;
the seaman, poor fellow! was a good deal burnt, but
he afterwards recovered. On examining the mainmast,
we found it splintered in many places, particularly
about the hoops, and in the wake of the trusses,
where copper had been nailed on.</p>

<p>The next day we stood towards Barcelona, in the
hopes of rejoining the <i>Orion</i>, but between nine and
ten in the morning of the 17th, the sea rose all round
us, angry, black, threatening clouds, accompanied with
water-spouts, and heavy flashes of lightning, gave us
warning that a tempest of no common kind was
approaching; several land birds of various descriptions,
blown from land not in sight, settled on the deck and
rigging, in hopes of shelter from the pitiless storm;
a woodcock tried to rest upon the capstern on the
quarter-deck; a hoopoe, linnets, greenfinches, and
other small birds, also endeavoured, poor things! to
find shelter, but when the first burst of the tempest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
came on, they were blown to leeward, and probably
perished. In the midst of all this we had to fire guns
at the water-spouts to break them, furl the sails, and
prepare for another gale. At eleven a heavy sea pooped
us, stove in the dead lights, and filled the captain’s
cabin with water; the wind increased to a perfect
hurricane, and at one, the lightning again struck the
ship and hurt the main-topmast and the main-mast.
At two the storm stay-sails were blown to atoms, and
the ship became entirely unmanageable; whole seas,
at times, rolled over her, one of which, breaking on
the quarter, struck the rudder, and the rudder-head
gave way, it was immediately chocked, and the ship
was then steered by the rudder pennants. Between
three and four, the main-topmast was blown over the
side, the rudder-chains gave way, and we found the
main-mast sprung a few feet above the quarter-deck.
The whole of the night, the rudder, having nothing to
confine it, thumped about a great deal, and made us
fear it would shake the stern-post. In the morning of
the 18th, the ship fortunately took a heavy plunge,
and the rudder unshipped itself from the stern and
sank. The sea at this period was most heavy and
breaking; it stove the quarter boats, and caused
the ship to strain so much that it was necessary to
keep the pumps constantly going. Towards noon of
the 18th we veered a cable astern with hawsers, etc.,
and struck the mizen-topmast to try and wear ship,
but found it impossible, for the moment we got the
ship four or five points from the wind, she flew to
again. On the 19th, the weather began to moderate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
but still there was a heavy sea; yet, notwithstanding
the ship laboured a great deal, we commenced making
a Pakenham’s jury rudder out of a spare maintopmast-jibboom,
and other spars.</p>

<p>Towards evening we saw the Columbretes, small
rocky uninhabited islands, near Ivica, on the lee bow,
distant four or five leagues; finding ourselves drifting
bodily down on them, we made all sail on the foremast,
in the hopes of getting the ship on the other
tack, veered away a cable astern, and with hawsers
bowsed it over to windward; but the heavy swell,&mdash;the
moment we got way upon the ship, and she was a few
points from the wind, striking her abaft the beam,&mdash;made
her fly to the wind again. We therefore furled
our sails, and let go an anchor in 60 fathoms, with a
spring on the cable, which for a time brought us up;
but soon after midnight, during my watch, there came
on a heavy squall with thunder, lightning and rain,
the ship drove, when we cut the cable and set new
storm stay-sails and fore-sail; she evidently would not
weather the rocks, but when pretty near them, it
pleased Providence to send us a shift of wind in
another severe squall, which enabled us to clear them.
On the morning of the 20th the weather became
moderate, and towards evening, having completed our
jury-rudder, we succeeded in shipping it, and found to
our great joy it answered with a little care very well.
The 21st we had a steady breeze from the S.W.,
which enabled us to shape our course for Malta. It
was necessary to keep a sharp look out upon our
rudder guys and braces, for the constant friction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
against the ship’s sides, soon chafed the woulding.
On the 22nd, at night, it again blew very heavy, our
starboard fore channel was very badly started, and
we found the fore-yard sprung; however the ship
steered very well, going before the gale at the rate
of ten and eleven knots per hour. On the 26th we
arrived at Malta, and moored safely from the gales in
La Valette harbour. The defects of the ship were as
follows: a rudder, main-mast, two top-masts, both
lower yards, maintop-sail-yard, the starboard fore
channel had to be secured, and general caulking was
wanted. In short, the ship was strained all to pieces.</p>

<p class="p2">After the repairs were made good, which took nearly
two months, we sailed for Messina, and found there
some transports waiting for a convoy to take a reinforcement
of troops, with General Sherbrooke, to
Egypt.</p>

<p>The service being most pressing, we took them
under convoy, and after a passage of three weeks,
made the low sandy coast to the westward of Alexandria,
on which were growing a few date or palm trees,
planted in a cluster. We got off the port on the
following day, where we no sooner discovered the
British squadron, under Capt. Benjamin Hallowell, in
the <i>Tigre</i> (80), all snug, than we hove to; and putting
the general and his staff on board one of the transports,
started back to Messina. The <i>Tigre</i> fired guns
and made the signal of recall, which the captain,
much to our satisfaction, would not notice, for we had
no particular relish to exchange the chance of a good
cruise, for the burning sands of Egypt, to fire at Turks
behind sand banks and stone walls.</p>

<p>This, however, very nearly got Captain Peter Parker
into a serious scrape; for the gallant old Ben. was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
most wroth, and nothing saved him from a court
martial but his being a great friend of Lord Collingwood.</p>

<p>On our return to Sicily we went from Messina to
Palermo, and from thence to succour the fortress of
Gaeta, near Terracina, besieged by Marshal Massena,
with 30,000 men. We ran in and engaged a battery
and a French man-of-war brig near Mola. The
battery was thrown up in Cicero’s Garden. Night,
and a very heavy thunder storm coming on, which
blew dead on shore, obliged us to haul off and get an
offing; the brig taking advantage of the darkness, cut
her cable, and got safe into Naples.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, I went with some other
officers on shore, to be introduced to the Prince of
Hesse Philippsthal, who commanded the fortress, and
to look round the works and observe the French lines.
It appearing to our captain that we could flank the
enemy’s works to the N.W. of the peninsula, with the
ship, in the afternoon, we stood in and fired a few
broadsides, which put them to confusion, however the
wind failing obliged us to haul off. A day or two
afterwards the wind changing and permitting us to do
the same thing, again we stood in, but the French had
got something prepared for us this time, in the shape
of a good masked battery, which was so well directed
that every shot hit us, and we were glad to get off
with the loss of three men badly wounded; one poor
fellow lost both his legs, another his right leg, and the
third was severely wounded by a splinter. We took
the hint and did not go there any more. Shortly after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
this, Rear-Admiral Sir Sidney Smith came and assumed
the command of the squadron, he used to send
the launches, armed with a carronade, every dark
night to flank the French camp on the Terracina side,
with orders the moment the gun was fired to pull
either to starboard or port, in order to avoid the
enemy’s shot. Our being low on the water prevented
them seeing us, so that they could only fire at the
flashes of our guns. Some shot occasionally passed
over us, but the greater part went either to the right
or left. One of the Sicilian gun-boats was sunk one
night, and some of the oars knocked out of the men’s
hands, but by attending to the orders of the gallant
admiral we generally escaped. Our other orders from
him were not to go within musket shot, and directly
the moon began to appear, to disperse and return
on board. One night we killed a French general
named Vaubois, who had come down to the beach
with some field pieces to return our fire.</p>

<p>We went hence to Palermo and landed our wounded
men, when we proceeded off Naples with a spy, dispatches,
and proclamations, from King Ferdinand the
VII., to his beloved subjects, calling upon them to
rise and make a diversion to raise the siege of Gaeta;
but they were too wise to follow his advice, having
neither leaders, spirit, nor enterprise for such dangerous
work. To get the above gentleman with his dispatches,
proclamations, &amp;c., on shore, being a service
of danger, with the prospect at least of a dungeon for
the remainder of the war, should they even escape
hanging, volunteers were necessary; myself and a fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>
gig’s crew and a sergeant of marines, offered our services,
and engaged not to return without performing
the service if it were possible.</p>

<p>We were all well armed and left the ship in the gig,
with the spy, soon after dark, at the entrance of the
Bay of Naples; the oars were well muffled and greased
to prevent them from making a noise. We first rowed
under the land towards Baia and Pansilippo; the
night was favourable, being very dark, and rather
inclined to be stormy, with an occasional flash of sheet
lightning, which latter we could have dispensed with;
however, on we pulled, taking care not to feather the
oars, and to row as easy as possible, that we might
make no splashing in the water. At last we got to
what I thought a favourable place, and we pulled in,
when just as the boat was touching the shore a whole
host of fishermen bawled out and gave the alarm.
The alarm fires were lit along the shore in a minute,
and we were instantly challenged; off we shoved the
boat and told the Italian to say we were fishermen
looking for our companions. While he was talking
the wind being off the land, soon blew us out of
hearing and musket shot, when we again rowed along
shore nearer Naples, and tried to land upon the rocks,
not far from Castle del Ovo; here again, however, the
fellows were upon the <i>qui vive</i>, and we again shoved
off, when I determined to put a good face upon the
matter, and after passing the castle to land right under
the houses. They not expecting us there, we succeeded,
and our friend the spy, with his dispatches
and proclamations, went at once into the city, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
then shoved off and got safe back to the ship by a
little after midnight; the captain was quite happy to
see us safe returned, having so well accomplished our
object. Having seen the alarm fires and signals from
the ship, he was very anxious on our account.</p>

<p>The spy being a clever fellow, managed his business
well, and in a fortnight after returned safe to Palermo
with answers. Nothing was done, for King Joe and
his police kept too sharp a look out, to allow his
Sicilian Majesty’s corps of lazzaroni to make, or
attempt to make, any disturbance.</p>

<p>On our way off Cività Vecchia, near Mount Circello,
in company with the <i>Juno</i> (32), we fell in with two
French settees, who were steering along shore towards
Mola; one we sunk with our two guns, and the other
we took; both were laden with charcoal for the forges
of the French army before Gaeta; the <i>Juno</i> went
thither with our prize, and we continued off the above
place in the hope of falling in with a French squadron,
but in this we were anticipated by the <i>Sirius</i> (36),
who fell in with them, took a corvette, and dispersed
the rest. From thence we proceeded off Leghorn,
and on the 18th of May, 1806, at noon, I was sent,
with seven men, armed with merely four cutlasses, two
muskets, and having only eight ball cartridges, after a
French row-boat, with orders also to attack a convoy
close in shore under the town of Leghorn. This adventure
having nearly cost me my life, I shall enter
more fully into it. All hands were upon deck, ready
to carry any orders given into execution; a French
row-boat passed close to the ship, armed with muske<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>toons
and muskets, and having a crew of sixteen men.
The ship had French colours flying at the time, trying
to entice out the enemy’s convoy in shore, and therefore
Captain Parker would not permit a musket to be
fired to bring-to the small vessel passing near us. The
wind was light, and the row-galley had no sooner got
out of musket shot astern, than they out sweeps and
began to pull away, suspecting, notwithstanding our
French flag, that we were an English frigate. At this
time our distance from Leghorn might be about seven
or eight miles. A large polacre ship was seen to leeward,
which was taken for an enemy; we bore up and
made all sail after her, when I was called off the forecastle,
and ordered to jump into the starboard cutter
and go after the aforesaid galley; so much was I
hurried that permission was not even allowed me to
run below to my cabin, in the gun-room, to get my
sword and pistols, but, obeying orders, let the consequences
be what they might, having always been
drilled into me, away I went, rather sulkily I confess,
and when lowered down in the quarter-boat, I found
that instead of the proper boat’s crew, any men that
happened to be nearest, had been ordered into her;
amongst others, an Italian, a native of Leghorn, who
for some crime had been severely punished three days
before. Just as we were shoving off I discovered there
were neither muskets, pistols, nor swords in the boat;
after some little delay, two muskets, and four cutlasses,
with two cartouch boxes, were given us. With this
equipment, I ordered the boat tackles to be unhooked,
and away we pulled, but guess my astonishment, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
upon opening the cartouch boxes, I found the gunner’s
mate had given me the wrong ones, for one contained
five, and the other only three ball cartridges. In about
ten minutes after leaving the ship, the gig was sent to
join me, with orders to attack the convoy, and take as
many as possible. I therefore ordered the gig to go
and attack a merchant vessel, which I pointed out,
while I went after the row-galley. A short time
brought us within musket shot; at this period the
ship was four or five miles off to leeward, and we
about the same distance from the shore. The few
musket balls I had, were soon expended; observing,
however, that whenever I took up the musket and
pointed it the Frenchmen bobbed down, we pulled
alongside and boarded her, and for a few minutes we
had the vessel in possession, when a gun fired from
the shore unfortunately drew my attention. The
Italian whom I brought with me thinking it a good
opportunity for revenge, joined the Frenchmen, and
excited them to rise, and they being more than double
our numbers, soon overpowered us&mdash;stabbed one of
my men, threw two overboard, laid me sprawling by
a blow on the head and a cut in my right hand. In
half-an-hour I was safely landed in the lazaretto at
Leghorn. I must do the enemy the justice to say,
that the moment they had recaptured their vessel,
they picked up the two men thrown overboard.</p>

<p>We remained in the lazaretto three weeks, a surgeon
coming occasionally to see the wounded man
and myself, and give us some plasters. We not being
touchable on account of our quarantine, old Sangrado<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
brought a long slender white stick, with which he used
to feel the seaman’s wound,&mdash;a stab in the left side,&mdash;and
my hand; however we did not trouble the old
fellow long, for low diet and good constitutions soon
healed flesh wounds.</p>

<p>At the expiration of three weeks, we were considered
free from any possibility of our having the
plague; a guard of French soldiers was therefore sent
down to the door of the lazaretto, and we were committed
to their charge and marched to the sound of an
old brass drum to the fortress at Leghorn, where I had
the option, either to sign a parole not to attempt to
quit it, or be locked up in a prison. Of two evils
always choose the least,&mdash;escape was impossible, for
the castle or citadel was built upon a small islet joined
to the town by a draw-bridge; a strong guard was
constantly mounted there, and at sunset the bridge
was hauled up, and the sea surrounded the place on
all sides, while sentinels were posted at every angle.
I therefore was glad to have permission from ten in
the morning until six in the evening to walk round
the fortress to breathe fresh air, with a young Russian
mid who was taken with me. After that period we
were locked up in the prison of the fortress until the
next morning, when we were again let out to enjoy
fresh air.</p>

<p>For prisoners, we were treated very well. I was
allowed tenpence a day to live upon, which, with occasional
presents received from kind, friendly people
in the town, we managed very well. For the first
few nights our beds were rather too full of light and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
heavy cavalry; but by adopting the plan of lying
down in them a good half-hour before going to sleep,
and then throwing off the clothes, and setting to
work with a good will, in the course of a week most
of the bugs and fleas were got rid of, and we enjoyed
tolerable rest.</p>

<p>At this period Leghorn was placed in a happy state
of suspense, between being in actual possession of the
French and under the government of the Queen of
Etruria. The former held all the fortifications, as an
army of observation, while the latter was acknowledged
for a short time longer, because it suited the views of
the French emperor, and we were permitted to have a
kind of acting consul there, who was a most worthy,
excellent man&mdash;the Rev. J. Hall&mdash;whose kindness I
shall never forget. He had a very delightful family.
What became of them after the French took the
entire possession of the country I never knew. Some
American merchants also (particularly a Mr. Purviance)
showed me every attention when I was let out of
prison. I tried, through the Rev. J. Hall, to get myself
and boat’s crew liberated, claiming the protection of
the Etrurian Government, they not being actually at
war with England, and professing neutrality, but I
soon found it was useless, for they dare do nothing to
displease the French. However, most luckily for me,
a friend of Joseph Bonaparte’s, who was at that
time King of Naples, had been captured in a French
corvette, <i>La Bergère</i>, and he sent out a flag of truce
to Admiral Sir Sidney Smith, offering me in exchange
for his friend, who was at Malta, which our admiral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
agreed to. At the expiration of six weeks I was,
to my great joy, liberated, and took up my quarters
in the town, where I remained more than a fortnight,
visited Pisa, and Monte Negro, and amused myself
about the town, until an opportunity offered of my
getting to Palermo.</p>

<p>Luckily, a Danish merchant brig was at this time
ready for sailing, and I took my passage on board
her, for, just when I was going to embark, an order
came from King Joseph for me to be sent to him
at Naples. My passport was signed and given me,
and my bill of health from the quarantine office was
likewise in my possession; the wind being fair, the
brig was getting under. Had I been differently
situated with regard to money and clothes, I would
have risked placing myself in the hands of King
Joseph, for the delight of travelling, even as a prisoner,
by land to Naples, for the novelty of the thing; but
my thread-bare coat, empty pockets, and tattered
garments decided me to get on board the Dane as
fast as possible, and run the risk of being taken out
“<i>vi et armis</i>,” rather than go in such a shabby plight
to Naples. Our acting consul hurried me off, telling
me the police were after me. I was immediately put
into a boat, and got safe on board, with two of my
men, and the young Russian, who, by-the-bye, afterwards
turned out to be a Frenchman, sent into our
service by Bonaparte, through Russian influence, with
some of their own youngsters, and passed off on our
Government as a Russian. All that I can say is, that
he was a clever, smart lad. I met him in Paris in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>
1818 (Lieutenant de Vaisseau), when he laughed at
the trick that had been played, and told me several
more Russian midshipmen in our service were young
Frenchmen. This was done by some of the Emperor
Alexander’s official servants, when it was the
policy of Russia after the fatal battle of Austerlitz, in
December, 1805, to endeavour to please Napoleon.
Very probably the Russian agent received a douceur
for the transaction, and as for humbugging John
Bull, and taking advantage of his good-nature, this,
added to a breach of faith and confidence, was of
little consequence when compared with other matters.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>I must confess that, until the time we were safe
under sail, which was more than an hour after we
got on board, my eye watched every boat with
anxiety, expecting to see some French soldiers sent
to take me out; nor was I quite satisfied of my
safety until we had sailed through the Piombino
Passage, which we did before dark, when I began
to think I might whistle with safety, being well “out
of the wood,” and in the probable track of some of
our cruisers.</p>

<p>After a pleasant passage of five days, we arrived
safe at Palermo, and from thence I proceeded in a
transport for Malta to look for the <i>Melpomene</i>.</p>

<p class="summary">Malta&mdash;Dreadful accident by the Explosion of a Magazine in the
town, on the Bermola side&mdash;Nearly get into a scrape about breaking
quarantine&mdash;Kind answer of the gallant Admiral Sir Sidney Smith to
the complaint&mdash;Rejoin the <i>Melpomene</i>&mdash;Mutiny in Fribourg’s regiment&mdash;Cruise
in the Adriatic.</p>

<p class="p2">On my arrival at Malta I learnt that the ship was on
a cruise, and that she had lost, a short time after I was
taken, our gallant first lieutenant, Andrew Thompson,
who was killed, with most of his boat’s crew, in
boarding,&mdash;in the middle of the day, with the barge
alone,&mdash;a French armed settee, with six long nine-pounders,
off Leghorn; but the few survivors&mdash;Lieutenant
Gascoigne, R.M.; Mr. W. Butler, mid;
and a noble fellow, a sergeant of marines, named
Milligan, with eight seamen, all that remained out
of twenty-five men&mdash;gallantly hooked on the boat,
and carried the vessel, driving some of her crew
overboard, and causing the rest to beg for quarter.</p>

<p>At the prize agent’s I found my chest of clothes,
which had been left behind to be forwarded to England,
it not being expected I should rejoin the ship.
This was a great and unexpected comfort. The
delight of a nice new coat, linen, &amp;c., after my poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
ragged dress was a treat, which, fully to enjoy, a
person should be placed in a similar situation.</p>

<p>I was sent on board the <i>Madras</i> (guard-ship) to
wait for a passage to join the <i>Melpomene</i>, when,
in August, a dreadful accident happened. I was
awakened out of sleep about six in the morning by
a tremendous noise, and the bursting of shells. I
jumped out of bed, and ran upon deck, thinking we
were in action, when a shell fell upon the wharf to
which the ship was secured, burst, and killed the
gunner of the <i>Madras</i>. An immense cloud of black
smoke and dust was hovering in the air, and cries,
shrieks, and groans were heard in every direction:
a magazine in the centre of the town of Bermola,
nearly opposite the dockyard, in which many live
shells had been placed by the French during the
siege in 1800, had exploded. A party of artillerymen
had been sent to take out the fuses, and by some
unfortunate accident one shell had gone off, for one
or two explosions were heard before the magazine
blew up. How the event happened of course not a
soul employed was left to tell, and, in addition to
a sergeant’s party of artillerymen, nearly 300 of the
inhabitants were killed or seriously injured; part of
two streets were thrown down, and many more houses
were severely shaken.</p>

<p>A short time after this shocking event, a transport
was directed to sail for Palermo, and a passage thither
was ordered for me to look for my ship. Outside of
Malta harbour we were boarded by a boat, bringing a
lieutenant and some men from a vessel in quarantine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
to join their ship also at Palermo. The wind, which
had been fair, suddenly changed, and the weather
appearing unsettled, the master prudently bore up,
and returned into harbour. I thought it very hard
to be placed in quarantine, because we had taken
the above officer and men out from the lazaretto,
therefore the moment the ship dropt anchor, without
waiting for the pratique boat to come alongside, I
got into a shore boat, and landed in the town of
Valette.</p>

<p>Fortunately, as soon as I had landed, the captain
of the <i>Madras</i> met me, and instantly sent me back
to the transport, saying, if the quarantine officer found
me out, I should be sent to prison. The next
morning the wind came fair, and we put to sea.
Just when we had got clear of the harbour&mdash;the
pratique office having gained intelligence of my visit
to the shore&mdash;a boat was sent after the ship to take
me out, and place me in the lazaretto; but the wind
freshening, we left her astern, and proceeded on our
voyage to Palermo, where I expected that nothing
more would have been thought of the matter.</p>

<p>From thence I went on board the <i>Thunderer</i> (74),
for a passage to Naples, where I was taken very ill
with a kind of cholera morbus, which in a few hours
reduced me very much, but a good constitution
enabled me soon to recover from its attack, although
it left me very weak for some time.</p>

<p>On our arrival off Naples we found cruising at the
entrance of the bay the gallant Admiral Sir Sidney
Smith, who sent for me on board the <i>Pompée</i> (80),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
and said, “What is this you have been doing? You
are a very pretty fellow! This morning a brig came
from Malta, bringing a formal complaint against you
from the governor for breaking quarantine, and requesting
me to send you back there to be tried; but,”
added he, in the kindest manner, “never mind, I have
answered them, and told them they, not you, were to
blame, for had they done their duty you could never
have got on shore, and it was entirely owing to their
neglect that you transgressed the quarantine laws.”
That answer settled the matter, and I never heard
anything more of the affair, although, after joining the
<i>Melpomene</i>, which I did in the course of a few days,
the ship was sent to Malta to refit.</p>

<p>I was quite delighted to get back to my old ship,
and be under the command of her dashing gallant
young captain, who, had he not been killed afterwards
in America, would have now been one of the best
officers in the service. Shortly after our arrival at
Malta, in September, a most serious mutiny broke out
in a foreign regiment in our service, quartered at Fort
Recazzoli, called “Fribourg’s,” or the Greek Light
Infantry. It was composed of Germans, Swiss,
French, Greeks, Istrians, Dalmations, and Albanians.
Most of the officers were Germans, and the discipline
of the regiment did not suit the ideas of these mercenaries;
added to which, some of the Albanians and
Dalmatians had been most shamefully cajoled by
emissaries, under false promises, into our service. In
those countries a kind of clanship prevails, and some
of the heads of those clans were told, that if they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
would enter, with their followers, into this regiment,
they would receive the rank of captain. These wild
chiefs, thinking it a great thing to be made captain at
once in the British service, embarked with their followers,
and came to Malta, where, instead of being
placed in the situation they expected, they were put
into the ranks, and one or two of them made a sergeant
or corporal. This, with other causes, created a general
disgust, and a secret plan was formed by these wild
tribes to rush into the officers’ mess-room, while at
dinner, and murder every one of them indiscriminately.
Suspecting, however, that their plan had been discovered,
they did not wait for dinner time, but about
two or three o’clock in the afternoon, rose upon the
few officers that were in the fort at the time, killed a
captain, the adjutant, and quarter-master, wounded
the colonel and major, whose lives were saved by the
Germans, and hauling up the drawbridge, demanded
terms, which were that the regiment should be disbanded,
and themselves sent back to their own
country.</p>

<p>In the fort at this time was a gallant young officer
of artillery, Lieutenant Fead, with a few of his men,
one or two of whom refusing, like good soldiers, to
quit their post without orders from their own officer,
the mutineers killed them, making Lieutenant Fead
prisoner, obliging him to point the guns and mortars
towards the town of La Valette.</p>

<p>Fort Recazzoli is a strong isolated fortress on the
left hand side of Malta harbour as you come in from
the sea, and in which was a large magazine of gun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>powder.
The mutineers held out several days, and
threatened to fire upon the town of La Valette if their
terms were not immediately agreed to. One day
indeed they did fire a few shells, but Lieutenant Fead
purposely gave the mortars so much elevation, that
the shells dropped quite clear of the town. Things
had remained in this state for two or three days, with
all the garrison at Malta and the seamen and marines
of the few ships in harbour on the alert, boats rowing
guard, the batteries manned, and a cordon of troops
drawn round the fort; when, on the afternoon of the
second day a grand tiraillade was heard within it, the
Germans and Swiss, with the few artillerymen who
had taken no part in the mutiny, and had been disarmed
by the others, watching an opportunity, made
a rush, destroyed the guard at the drawbridge, let it
down, and sallied forth out of the fortress, bringing
with them one or two wounded officers and forty-five
of the principal malcontents; the remainder hauled up
the drawbridge and held out for several days, again
demanding terms, and threatening to blow up the
magazine if they were not complied with.</p>

<p>The mutineers being now reduced to a few, early
in the morning, we stormed the place with scaling
ladders, when part of the 44th Regiment and some
sailors got possession of most of the fort; but the
mutineers had not been idle, they had built up a kind
of high breast-work of large loose stones before the
magazine, within which they retreated, and kept up a
brisk fire of musketry&mdash;a ball from which grazed my
hat and stuck in the wall near me. They used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
occasionally, from behind this breast-work, to demand
a parley and terms, always ending with the threat of
blowing up the magazine, with themselves, in which
were several hundred barrels of gunpowder. General
Valette, who commanded the garrison, very properly
refused to listen to any but an unconditional surrender&mdash;things
having gone too far.</p>

<p>We stationed our men under the bomb proofs,
it being the general opinion of the engineer officers
that when the magazine did blow up the greatest
explosion would be towards the sea, where the wall
of the magazine was weakest, and that under the
bomb proof the men would be comparatively safe;
and as these desperate fellows had declared, that if
when St. John’s clock should strike the hour of nine
in the evening, their terms, free pardon and safe conduct
back to their own country, were not complied
with, they would set fire to the train and blow themselves
and the fortress up, we awaited the event with
much anxiety. A strong suspicion existing that they
had undermined the garrison, and had made a passage
out for themselves at the back of it, I was sent to row
guard to intercept any attempt they might make to
escape by water. At about nine, off went the train,
and a most awful explosion took place; the whole
sea wall was blown to atoms, and the shock like that
of an earthquake was felt far and near, some fish in the
harbour made a spring out of the water, which showed
they also were sensible of the vibration. Three of the
44th Regiment who were posted sentinels were killed
by the falling stones, and a few more were hurt. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
immediately pulled on shore and had communication
with the fort, and then went and made my report to
the senior naval officer. These desperate wretches, at
first, were considered to have perished, but, about a
week afterwards they were brought in, nearly starved
to death, having been unable to make their escape
from the island. They were immediately tried by a
court martial and hanged.</p>

<p>To return to those forty-five mutineers dragged out
of the fortress by the sortie. They were also brought
before a military tribunal; fifteen of them were condemned
to be hanged, and most of the remainder
to be shot. The execution was most terribly mismanaged:
it presented, indeed, a shocking spectacle.
But I will say no more upon the subject, further than
to the last moment these poor wretches continued to
vent their abuse on the English, and the men sentenced
to be hanged endeavoured to keep up the
spirits of those that were about to be shot&mdash;even
when the ropes were round their necks they called
to them, saying, “What are you crying for? It is
we that ought to bewail our fate of being hanged like
dogs instead of being shot like men.”</p>

<p>I recollect seeing a Catholic priest very busy on
the scaffold, wishing to persuade the criminals to kiss
the crucifix before they were launched into eternity,
but they kicked him off, and spat in his face, telling
him he was no better than themselves.</p>

<p>In November we sailed on a cruise off Corfu, and
from thence up the Adriatic, where we spent a very
stormy winter, blockading Venice, anchoring occa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>sionally
at Trieste, and under Cape Salvatore, the
islands of Lissa, Sansego, and various other places.
The N.E. winds in winter blow most furiously from
the Istrian and Dalmatian mountains, and, if caught
by these winds on the Italian coast, a ship is placed
in a most critical situation; a heavy, short sea rises
with the wind, and you are obliged to carry a press of
canvas to prevent being driven on a lee shore.</p>

<p>A Russian squadron of seven sail of the line,
besides frigates and transports, with troops on board,
arrived from Naples early in the spring of 1807, and
anchored off Trieste, the Emperor of Russia having
withdrawn his alliance from us, professing neutrality,
in consequence of the great success of the French
army under Napoleon in Austria, &amp;c. The Russian
admiral, Greig, very politely sent to Captain Pat.
Campbell, of the <i>Unité</i>, the senior officer in the
Adriatic, to say that he intended to send a ship of
the line with the transports to land the troops they
had on board at Venice, we being off the port
blockading it, in company with the <i>Unité</i>. Captain
P. Campbell replied that two British frigates would
never suffer one Russian seventy-four, with her convoy,
to break the blockade, and therefore requested,
if that was the admiral’s intention, he would take
his whole force, which would prevent any collision
between us.</p>

<p>Admiral Greig very properly did so, and saw his
convoy enter safely the port of Venice.</p>

<p>During the nine months we cruised in this sea we
took and destroyed a great many of the enemy’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
small vessels; but our prize concerns were unfortunately
entrusted to agents, who became insolvent,
and our hard-earned money was in consequence lost.
I shall in the sequel suggest a plan for the management
of prize-money, in the event of our again being
engaged in war, it having fallen to my lot to lose
every penny by the breaking of four agents in different
parts of the world, into whose hands we
entrusted the management of our prize affairs.</p>

<p>These honest people have an easy way of getting
rid of money committed to their charge. A ship
brings captured vessels into harbour; on board comes
Mr. A., B., C, or D., with a smirking face and soft
tongue, making low bows, hoping he may have the
honour,&mdash;being an accredited agent under a bond for
£20,000,&mdash;to transact the affairs of H.M. ship! Officers
generally being strangers in the port, and having
orders frequently to proceed to sea again in forty-eight
hours, after completing water and provisions,
have no time to look after or make inquiries about
<i>stability</i> of prize agents, and therefore trust the concerns
to the first that comes. The moment a ship is
fitted out she goes to sea on another cruise&mdash;probably
for three or four months; the prizes in the meanwhile
are sold by the agent. Now, what does he generally
do with the money? Why! speculates with it on his
own account. If the scheme answers, he puts the
amount of his speculation into his own pocket&mdash;we,
whose the money ought to be, never getting any part
of it. If it fails, the prize agent breaks, and off he
starts, paying perhaps not a shilling in the pound.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
Oh! but then you have got his bond for £20,000!
What matters this amongst a whole fleet, when he
runs away with perhaps more than £100,000 of their
money!</p>

<p>I am not putting an extreme case&mdash;this did happen
more than once&mdash;and it would astonish the public if
the whole system of prize-plundering agents that was
carried on last war could be laid open. They would,
indeed, wonder men could be so easily led to trust
persons with large sums of money without knowing
more about them. My reply is, necessity obliges them.</p>

<p>Now, the remedy I propose is this. Let the Government,
in the event of another war, take the prize
agency into their own hands, and deduct an eighth or
a quarter to cover all expenses, and, whenever ships
leave a station, let the money be sent to England.
Government would have the use of it; the officers
and ships’ companies would be sure to receive the
remainder; and it would be much better to give up
an eighth or a quarter to Government to make sure
of the rest than to lose, as has happened in many
cases, every sixpence of our hard-earned reward.</p>

<p>But to return to our cruise. One morning watch,
during the time we were washing decks, and when
the after-skylight gratings were off, a strange sail
was seen from the topmast-head. Without thinking
of such things as hatchways, back I ran from the fore
part of the quarter-deck to hail the maintop-masthead,
and to ask the man looking out what she
looked like, when, just as I had placed my speaking-trumpet
to my mouth, head over heels down the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
after-hatchway I fell, bang into the gun-room. Fortunately,
I came off with only a severe bruise, and
the spraining of my right ankle, which laid me up for
three weeks.</p>

<p>The vessel proved to be an enemy’s small coaster,
called a “trabaculo,” the rig of which is merely two
large lug-sails, with a boom at the foot of them, with
a jib, and sometimes a stay-sail and top-sail, to be
set flying when going before the wind. She was in
ballast, from Chiozza, bound to Ancona for a cargo.
On searching the prisoners for letters and papers, we
found concealed in their waistbands and linings of
their clothes seven hundred and sixty-eight gold
Venetian zechins, besides some dollars, which we
took the liberty of extracting. They belonged to a
rich Venetian merchant, and he had sent the money
on board, under the charge of the master of the
vessel, to purchase her cargo. On our chasing him,
seeing no means of escape, he distributed the money
amongst the men to sew in their dresses.</p>

<p>When we first captured him, finding the vessel
without anything in her, Captain Parker was on the
eve of letting her go, when the prying eyes of a
young mid made the discovery of the concealed
money, which we took from them, and then allowed
the vessel, with her crew, to return to her own port,
she not being worth the trouble of sending to Malta.</p>

<p>Some prizes in a gale of wind having been driven
on shore near Pesaro, on the coast of Italy, a flag
of truce came off to offer an exchange of prisoners, to
which we gladly acceded. I was sent thither, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>
two boats, to bring back our seamen and petty officers.
The French, seeing us coming, got the men
down on the pier, to have them ready. Several
officers of that nation, who were standing there, came
bowing and scraping to the stairs of the landing-place,
making a great number of fine speeches, and
offering me refreshments of all kinds, if I would do
them the honour to walk up into the town, which
I gladly accepted, hoping to rest my boats’ crews
and stretch my legs for half-an-hour on shore, after
blockading their ports for six months.</p>

<p>Just when I was stepping out of the boat I observed
they held a consultation. Afterwards one of the officers
came up to me, and said that he was very sorry,
but orders had just arrived for them on no account
to suffer me to come out of my boat. Now this was
utterly false, no one having come near them, for I
kept my eye upon them the whole time. “It was
very unfortunate&mdash;they were quite in despair about
it,” holding up their hands, shrugging up their
shoulders, and making wry faces all the time; “they
wished so much to show me civility&mdash;refreshments
were already laid out at their lodgings&mdash;but what
could they do?&mdash;they were so sorry&mdash;but orders must
be obeyed.” So, taking off their cocked hats, they
wished me adieu. I returned the salute, thanked
them for the trouble they had taken in getting a
repast ready for me, which the authorities would not
permit me to enjoy; then off we shoved the boats,
and, after a long pull, got back to the ship with our
exchanged shipmates, much amused with the French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
offer of refreshments, which it was never intended I
should partake of.</p>

<p>We continued in the Adriatic until the end of
September, 1807, when we proceeded to Trieste to
embark Lord Pembroke and suite, and carry them
to England. They had come from Vienna. Amongst
his lordship’s suite were Sir William A’Court, the
present Lord Heytesbury, and a Mr. Hammond. They
were all pleasant, gentlemanly men, and although bred
in Courts, where little else than cold-heartedness and
deceit are learned, they in a short time won the esteem
of us unsophisticated sailors.</p>

<p>After a stormy passage of nearly six weeks, we
anchored at Spithead, when I found myself appointed
lieutenant of H.M. Ship <i>Swiftsure</i> (74), bearing the
flag of my much-esteemed friend and admiral, Sir
John Borlase Warren, who had been appointed commander-in-chief
on the Halifax station.</p>

<p>After an absence from England of three years, the
ship being on the point of sailing, I could only get
one day’s sight of home, when I set off to join my
new ship at Plymouth, and the end of November
sailed for the North American station to relieve
Admiral Berkeley, where we remained three years
and a half.</p>

</div>

<p class="summary">North American station, from 1808 to 1811&mdash;Bermuda&mdash;Anecdote&mdash;Death
of Captain Conn.</p>

<p class="p2">We had a long passage out, running far to the southward,
and crossing the tropic of Cancer before we
hauled to the westward for the islands of Bermuda.
In a squall we carried away the fore-yard, which,
being a bad stick, went in three pieces. However,
we soon made another, which answered our purposes
remarkably well, and at the end of six weeks we
arrived in Murray’s anchorage.</p>

<p>These islands consist of a group of three hundred
and sixty-five, which the Bermudians tell you is the
reason there are three hundred and sixty-five days in
the year. They are very picturesque, and covered
chiefly with sweet-smelling cedar trees, of whose
timber several fine 18-gun sloops-of-war and small
schooners have been built.</p>

<p>Had the Bermudians been permitted to follow their
own plan, no doubt these would have been very safe
vessels: but our Navy Board took out a <i>patent for
making coffins</i>, and sent them out plans and dimensions,
from which they were by no means to deviate.
The consequence was, such a tribe of little tubs, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
the shape of two and three-masted schooners, were
built, that it was absolutely throwing money away
to construct them. Several of them, indeed, did
founder, with all their crews. The ship-sloops were
certainly better&mdash;I may say, with truth, they were
favourites&mdash;very good sea boats, and in every respect
excellent vessels.</p>

<p>Besides cedar trees, these islands produce arrow-root
of the best quality, tobacco, Indian corn, &amp;c.,
but not in sufficient quantities for their own consumption:
they, therefore, import flour and other
articles of food from the United States, and other
places. Abundance of fish is taken, such as grouper&mdash;which
is a fine, firm fish of the rock species, frequently
weighing several pounds&mdash;chub, porgay, and
various other kinds; and in the spring of the year
a spermaceti whale fishery is carried on, this species
frequenting those seas at that period.</p>

<p>The scenery of these islands is very pretty. Everything
here is in miniature&mdash;little hills, valleys, and
lakes; whilst blue and red birds, flitting about under
a brilliant sun, give the whole the appearance of fairy
land. The heat in summer is very oppressive, and
the heavy tempests of wind, or, to use the native
expression, “the blow,” accompanied with frightful
storms of thunder and lightning, are most terrific.
In winter the gales generally commence from the
S.S.W. to S.W., and then fly round to the N.W. at
once in a most severe squall.</p>

<p>The approach to the Bermudas, amongst coral rocks
and breakers, is attended with great danger, unless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
you are quite sure of your reckoning. Before the
great improvements in navigation, many an unfortunate
vessel was wrecked on them.</p>

<p>The whole chain of these islands is formed like the
coral banks in the south seas; there are no real
springs of fresh water, and most of the inhabitants
get this necessary article from tanks attached to their
houses to catch the rain, and when these are dry they
go to wells dug in different parts of the sea coast,
through which the salt water filters, and becomes
tolerably sweet. From these the men-of-war, too,
generally get their supply, which has the effect of
Cheltenham water, and saves the trouble of applying
to the doctor.</p>

<p>With regard to society, much depends upon the
military and naval commanders-in-chief, the regiments,
and king’s ships. Some of the Bermudian
families are highly respectable.</p>

<p>Much merriment was afforded one evening at a
party, to which a naval captain, who is now dead, was
invited. He had come in from a long cruise, and had
been paying his addresses to a certain young lady living
on one of the islands; but the tongue of slander had
been busy against him during his absence, and on his
making a proposal she refused him. This came to
the ears of the lady of the house, who, wishing to quiz
the poor man, and to be very facetious, forgetting that
her husband had but one eye, and was not very
handsome otherwise, began her attack thus: “So,
Captain &mdash;&mdash;, I hear Miss &mdash;&mdash; has refused you,” and
went on very cruelly to torment the poor man, in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
distress, as ladies <i>can</i> do sometimes when they wish to
be <i>mischievous</i>. He bore it all for a long time with
great patience and forbearance; being goaded at
length beyond endurance, he rose from his chair and
said, “Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, when such an old, ugly fellow as your
husband, with but one eye, can get a pretty young
woman like yourself for a wife, I ought never to
despair.” And out he walked, the tables fairly turned
on the facetious dame. Having mentioned the word
“slander” in the above anecdote, I am induced to add
another story by way of advice to young ladies.</p>

<p>Whenever your friend&mdash;and many young ladies
have a confidential one&mdash;abuses or throws out hints
to the prejudice of your absent lover, listen to her
with caution. The following little tale will point out
the necessity of not relying entirely upon the recommendation
of bosom friends in love affairs, for it is an
old saying that all advantages in love, war, law, and
elections are considered fair. Two young ladies from
twenty-three to twenty-five years of age, who lived in
a large town in the north, were first cousins, and dear
confidential friends; the one, a widow, had soft, pretty,
languishing, blue eyes, that said, “pray do love me;”
the other, a spinster, had black, sparkling eyes, that
said, “you shall love me.” The former had an offer
of marriage from a widower, who had a son about
fifteen years of age, whom he wished to put into a
profession previous to his marriage, but wanted some
ready money to do so. He, therefore, proposed that
the fair widow should advance him the money necessary
to enable him to do it. She, very properly, consulted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
her friends; some gave one opinion, some another.
She hesitated between love and money&mdash;she called in
her cousin, Miss Black-eyes, who strongly advised her
by no means to part with her cash. She still hesitated,
asked other advice&mdash;sent for her cousin again&mdash;went
so far as to purchase her wedding dress and make
preparations for furnishing a house. In the meanwhile
Miss Black-eyes had had frequent communications
with the gentleman, and also with her cousin. At last,
she got some friends to back her opinion, and, finally,
the match was broken off. But the same day the
spinster gave the money to the gentleman, who had a
license ready&mdash;off they went to the next parish and
were married. Therefore, I say, be very cautious in
adopting any opinion where the least chance of a clash
of interest is likely to exist, particularly in <i>love</i> affairs.</p>

<p>Our cruises in winter, during the time we were on this
station, were generally to the southward. Sometimes
we ran down to the island of Porto Rico, the Mona
passage, and off Anegada, with the hope of picking
up some of the French vessels from Martinique or
Guadaloupe; but the whole time we remained here,
nearly four years, only one ship letter-of-marque, a
schooner, and brig, fell into our hands.</p>

<p>In our summer cruises, we, on one occasion, went to
Madeira; another time to Fayal, one of the western
isles, and when there, paid our respects to the nuns in
the convents, and bought some of their pretty wreaths
for ladies’ hair, beautifully made of parrots’ feathers, in
imitation of myrtle. When first we went to the bars
of the convent, the abbess sent some of the elder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
sisters to offer flowers for sale, but these finding no
market, she changed her set, and the next time some
pretty, interesting young nuns offered their goods,
which we immediately bought from such fair hands.
If the old harpy of an abbess went away for a minute
they used to smile, talk, and give us their hands to
kiss through the grates; and their handsome dark eyes
seemed to say, “Oh! that these bars were removed,
that I might get out of this horrid prison, to which I
am consigned by sordid parents to make way for some
male branch of the family.” Several of these young
ladies, we were informed, had been expatriated from
Portugal, from that motive. A short time after we left
Fayal, one young nun did make her escape with a
captain in the navy, who very honourably married her;
but her poor friend, who tried to accompany her, met
with a serious accident, falling down and breaking her
leg, when getting out of the convent window. She
was taken back to her cell, where, it was said, she
underwent purgatory upon earth.</p>

<p>When on the North American station I met with a
severe hurt, while making sail in chase, which laid me
up for a considerable period. A rope having got loose,
struck me on the face, broke my jaw, and knocked out
five of my teeth.</p>

<p>In winter, the ships used to rendezvous at Bermuda;
during summer at Halifax, Nova Scotia. At the latter
place we used to enjoy pleasant society, amongst
very kind-hearted and friendly people, whose pretty
daughters made sad havoc with the hearts of both the
army and navy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>After one of our long summer cruises I got leave of
absence for ten days, and travelled with a friend, an
officer of the Royal Engineers, in his gig, across the
country to Annapolis Royal; the scenery did not
strike me as being particularly interesting. I saw a
great deal of barren, dreary, uncultivated land, that
wanted the hand of man to clear it, and make it “bring
forth its fruit in due season.”</p>

<p>Driving along the road we frequently started coveys
of spruce partridges. I used occasionally, when time
permitted, to get a shot at them. These birds do not,
like our partridges, take to the fields, but on rising from
the ground always fly into fir trees; they are very stupid,
and once in a tree will allow you to shoot them all, provided
you begin with the lowest and proceed upwards.</p>

<p>I recollect at one place where we breakfasted after
leaving Windsor, a large brown bear and two cubs
had been caught during the night in a pit fall; the old
one was shot in the pit, and the young ones kept alive,
probably to be sent to England.</p>

<p>The native Mic Mac Indians are a poor race, those,
at least, that I saw in Halifax and its neighbourhood.
They are confined to a few families. They used to
come to the town in their slight bark canoes, bringing
game, and skins of the silver and black fox, and boxes
made of the bark of the birch tree, ornamented with
the small quills of the porcupine, dyed of various
colours. I have often been in their wigwams, and
always found the people civil. Some of the young
squaws were passable, but the old women frightful.
These wigwams are easily built: half a dozen poles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
placed triangularly and covered with the bark of the
birch tree, is the general plan; the fire is in the middle
of the hut, the smoke finding its way out at the top,
and by the door-way. These habitations appear
warm, and the inmates healthy. When travelling, the
women carry their babies in a kind of basket, strapped
to their back, which resembles the lower part of a
fiddle-case, peeping out of which their little smoked
faces have a curious appearance. After disposing of
their wares, these people generally get drunk and fight,
the men beating the squaws, who, in their turn, belabour
the men. It not unfrequently happens that
those who return by water contrive to upset their
canoes, when they lose all the articles they have bought;
it is, however, very rare that any of the crew are
drowned. Fish of various sorts are most abundant,
and the market very good. The harbour of Halifax
is safe, but sometimes difficult to make, on account of
the thick fogs, which in particular winds,&mdash;those from
south-east to south-west,&mdash;hang about the coast.</p>

<p>A very provoking circumstance occurred to one of
the lieutenants, who was a Welchman, and a married
man, during a cruise, caused by a nanny-goat eating
his letters that he had just received from England,
previous to his having read them.</p>

<p>A schooner joined us at sea from Bermuda, bringing
the mail and letters from there and Halifax, Nova
Scotia. We all felt very anxious about news, for it
was nearly ten months since we had heard from “sweet
home;” in consequence of our being out cruising, and
going from place to place, they had missed us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>The weather was squally when the above vessel
joined us with the letters, and by the time her boat
had reached us, and they were delivered to their owners,
it was necessary to turn the hands up to reef the topsails.
Poor M&mdash;&mdash;, for fear his letters should get wet
in his pocket, for it began to rain as well as blow, left
them for safety on the rudder-head in the wardroom,
and went on deck to his station. No sooner was the
evolution performed than down he ran below, thinking,
poor fellow! to have a nice, quiet reading of his two
letters from his wife, giving an account of a new bit
of mischief that had been added to his establishment
during his absence, for he had left his wife near her
confinement, previous to his leaving England. Now,
only imagine M&mdash;&mdash;’s rage, vexation, and consternation,
on beholding Mrs. Taffy, the Welch goat,
mounted on the rudder-head, very quietly eating up
the letters. One was quite gone, and a very small
corner of the other sticking out of the goat’s mouth,
which she was endeavouring to masticate with all
possible dispatch. “Nanny” was seized by the throat
in a moment, and measures adopted to make her
disgorge the precious writing, but all in vain, for she
had taken such good care to bite them in small pieces,
in order that they might the more easily be swallowed,
and readily digested, that not a fragment larger than
a crown piece was recovered, and he had to wait eight
long months more, before he got others to tell him the
contents of those, and give him information about his
family.</p>

<p>This was a trial of temper. We commiserated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
sympathised, and found fault with him for not putting
them in his pocket, writing-desk, or any safer place
than where he had left them; in short, he had all Job’s
comforters, but was obliged to have recourse to Dame
Patience, hoping that some other vessel might soon
come from home and bring him others. Eight long
months elapsed ere he received information from England&mdash;making
in the whole nearly eighteen months&mdash;a
vexatious period at any time, but still more so in his
case. The goat had been used to run in and out of the
ward-room, for she was a great pet, and generally
after dinner had some biscuit and a little wine or
grog given to her, which she was very fond of. After
the unfortunate affair of the letters she was banished
for a month. After that period it was forgotten, and
she came in for her biscuit and grog as usual.</p>

<p>On one of our spring cruises, in May, 1810, we lost
our captain (John Conn), who, in a fit of derangement,
jumped overboard out of his stern cabin, and
was drowned. He was a thorough seaman, and very
much beloved by us all. He served in Lord Rodney’s
fleet in the action of the 12th of April, 1782, and
commanded the <i>Dreadnought</i> (98), at the battle of
Trafalgar. He was mate of the <i>Ramilies</i> (74), Rear-Admiral
Thomas Graves, when she was lost in that
dreadful gale, which proved fatal to the <i>Ville de Paris</i>
(110), <i>Glorieux</i> (74), <i>Centaur</i> (74), and various other
men-of-war, transports, and merchant ships, in the
gulf stream, not far from the latitude of Bermuda,
when returning to England in August of that year
with the prizes taken by Lord Rodney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>He gave me a piece of advice respecting the coast
of America which I shall never forget, and as it is
of that sort which all seamen liable to be sent on the
North American station ought to be acquainted with,
I shall mention it here. “Never lay your ship to at
night in a gale of wind to the S.S.W. on the coast of
America on the larboard tack, for the wind generally
flies round at once to the N.W. with a heavy squall,
and takes the ship flat back.” It was this, and lying-to
under a main-sail, which caused the loss of the
<i>Ramilies</i> at that period. He often gave me an
account of that misfortune. It was as follows:&mdash;“We
were on the larboard tack, with a reefed main-sail
set. The gale commenced from S.E., and gradually
came round to the S.S.W., blowing extremely
hard. When in the middle watch of the night of the
16th of October, 1782, the wind flew round in a most
tremendous squall to the N.W., taking the ship aback,
and throwing her nearly on her beam ends. We
tried to brace the main-yard round, but, finding it
impossible, we cut the foot rope of the main-sail,
which was quite a new one, with the hope of splitting
it, but it was bound so tight against the mast and
rigging that we could not effect this. The ship at
this time had great stern-way upon her; the sea,
breaking over her poop, stove in the dead-lights and
windows, and filled the ward-room and admiral’s
cabin with water, and before anything could be done
the main-mast, mizen-mast, and foretop-mast went
over the side; the stern-post was much shaken, and
the ship, nearly a new one, sprung a dangerous leak.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
At daylight the whole convoy was scattered; many
of the vessels dismasted&mdash;some had foundered&mdash;and
the sea was covered with wreck; the wind blowing a
hurricane. By dint of perseverance, having thrown
overboard most of her guns and heavy stores, we
succeeded in keeping the ship afloat until the 22nd,
when, finding she would not float much longer, we
took advantage of a lull of wind, and saved the crew
on board a few of the merchant ships that had continued
by her.”</p>

<p>Captain J. Conn also mentioned that had the orders
of Rear-Admiral Graves been attended to the ship
would probably not have been lost. The admiral
came out of his cabin in the middle watch, and, after
looking about him and making his remarks to the
officer on deck, said, “It looks black under the lee
bow, and I see some flashes of lightning. Should the
clouds appear to near you, immediately haul up the
main-sail and wear ship.” Unfortunately the admiral
went into his cabin without sending for the captain,
who slept in the ward-room. The moment the admiral
had gone in, the officer of the watch ran down to
Captain S. M., and mentioned the directions he had
received. The captain replied, “It is my positive
order you do no such thing without first coming to
acquaint me.” The lieutenant of the watch had
scarcely got on deck when he saw that a most violent
squall, with shift of wind, was about to take place.
Down he ran to acquaint his captain, according to
orders, but before he could get again upon the deck
to give the necessary directions the mischief had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
done: she was taken aback, lost her masts, and was
finally abandoned and burnt&mdash;all owing to adhering
too closely to etiquette. The captain very properly
was never employed afterwards.</p>

<p>From Bermuda we sailed to Halifax, where, one
afternoon, a man fell from the main-top, and striking
first against the main-rigging, then against the spare topsail-yard
in the chains, dropped into the sea. Being
on deck, I ran to the gangway, and, seeing no time
was to be lost, jumped overboard, and, fortunately,
getting hold of the man just as he was sinking, I kept
him up until a boat was sent to our assistance. His
fall having been broken by the main-rigging, previous
to his striking the topsail-yard, was probably the
cause of his life being saved.</p>

<p>After remaining in port some time, orders arrived
from England for the 7th Fusiliers, commanded by
Lieutenant-Colonel Blakeney, to proceed to join the
army of Lord Wellington. We embarked the headquarters
and four hundred men of this fine regiment.
The remainder were sent out in other men-of-war,
and, after a passage of three weeks, were landed at
Lisbon. The officers were a most pleasant, gentlemanly
set of men; but out of the whole of those
whom we took thither only the gallant Sir Edward
Blakeney (now a Major-General) and another are
alive.</p>

<p>After returning to Halifax nothing of interest occurred
on the station for the remainder of our time,
except that Captain Charles Austen, a very amiable
man and excellent officer, who had been placed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
command of the <i>Swiftsure</i> in lieu of Captain Conn,
who was drowned, was appointed to the <i>Cleopatra</i>,
Captain Lloyd joining the former ship in his stead.</p>

<p>We returned to England in the spring of the year
1811, and the ship was paid off at Chatham.</p>

<p>After a month at home, I took a passage in the
<i>Port Mahon</i>, brig, of 18 guns, to Lisbon, and on the
11th of June arrived in the Tagus, and was placed on
the Admiralty list for promotion.</p>

<p class="summary">Lisbon&mdash;Trip to the Army of Lord Wellington&mdash;Montemor Novo,
O’Rodondo, Villa Vicosa, Elvas, Fort le Lippe.</p>

<p class="p2">I was appointed to a ship in the Tagus by the commander-in-chief,
Admiral Sir G. Berkeley, whose
amiable family treated me with great kindness and
attention.</p>

<p>Having but little to do, I passed much time in
examining the beautifully situated, but dirty town of
Lisbon. If it were not for the scavenger dogs which
prowl about and take “pot luck,” the streets would be
impassable from filth. Having a brother<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> in the 14th<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
Dragoons, with the army of Lord Wellington, whom
I had not seen for more than seven years, and a
remount of horses arriving from England for the
regiment, amongst which was one for my brother, I
thought it a very good opportunity of going to see
him.</p>

<p>The admiral having been so obliging as to grant
me a month’s leave of absence, on the 19th of July, I
accordingly left Lisbon, placing on the horse a pair of
saddle bags, blanket, great coat, sword and pistols,
together with some hams and brandy, which I was
told would be very acceptable in camp.</p>

<p>After a short ride, I embarked in a Portuguese
passage boat, with a motley group of persons. A sail
of three hours brought me safe to Aldea Galega, a
small town on the southern bank of the Tagus.</p>

<p>I was now about to travel in a strange country.
Unable to speak the language, and having no servant
to take care of my horse, the troops having gone forward
the previous day, I began to fear I should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
placed in some difficulty. Before me was a march of
five or six days,&mdash;during which my steed would require
that care a groom only could bestow,&mdash;I determined,
however, to push on and trust to fortune, and my
Portuguese vocabulary. Looking about the miserable
town of Aldea Galega for mules, I was lucky enough
to meet with a dismounted dragoon, belonging to the
14th, going to Lisbon, who informed me that the
detachment of his regiment, which I ought to have
accompanied, had marched from Galega only the day
before, and that by my making all haste, I most likely
should overtake them in less than forty-eight hours.
I pressed this man into my service, went to a commissary,
got two mules, on one of which I put my
baggage, mounting the soldier, with three days’ rations
for myself and cattle, on the other. In the evening
we left this town for a place called Pegoeus, twenty
miles distant, and after a most disagreeable ride
through a long stunted wood, with a heavy sandy soil,
in which the horse and mules sank half-way up their
knees at every step, a little before midnight reached
Pegoeus, a most wretched place, consisting of three
miserable dirty hovels, very much resembling cow-houses,
into one of which we entered, in order to rest
the horse and mules. Sitting down upon my baggage,
I loaded my pistols, as the house was full of ill-looking
Portuguese and Spanish muleteers and peasantry,
nearly all armed, and half drunk, and making a great
noise. Some people I was informed had been robbed
a few hours before of everything, near this very place.
Although very much tired, sleeping was out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>
question; I was therefore glad when daylight arrived.
While my cattle were being saddled, I was fain to
undress by the road-side, and shake off some score of
fleas that were scampering over me in all directions:
then mounting my horse, a cool ride of five hours
brought me to a small village called Vendas Novas,
where I remained a short time to get something to
eat, and rest the animals. Here we were fortunate
enough to get tea and eggs for breakfast, and I heard
to my great joy, that the detachment was only three
hours’ march ahead of me. At half-past nine we left
this place, and after riding sixteen miles in the heat of
the day, almost broiled, reached a tolerably good town
called Montemor Novo, built on a hill. At this place
are the remains of a Moorish castle.</p>

<p>I joined the troops going to the army under the
Hon. Major Butler, with whom I took up my quarters,
and the next day sent the dragoon back with the
mules. On the following morning at five we marched
for a town called Arryoles, where we arrived at ten.</p>

<p>Most of the Portuguese villages and towns in the
Alemtejo are dull and uninteresting, at least they
appeared so to me. The next morning early, we
moved to a small clean town called Vemeiro, only
eight miles distant, which, losing our way, we did not
reach until noon. I found it very pleasant marching
with the troops, not but that it was distressing to put
the inhabitants to so much trouble and inconvenience
turning them out of their rooms to quarter officers and
soldiers in them. It is but justice however to say that
the British officers and men generally conducted them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span>selves
with so much propriety, forbearance, and good
feeling towards the natives of the different towns where
they were billeted, that mutual regrets frequently took
place at parting. God forbid, old England ever should
be the scene of warfare. Contending armies are one of
the greatest scourges with which Divine providence
can afflict a nation. Even your allies cannot avoid
bringing with them desolation for a time, by destroying
crops of all kinds, to prevent their falling into the
hands of the enemy. In short, ruin and devastation
follow in the train of an army, whether friend or
foe.</p>

<p>Being near the town of Usagree, in Estramadura,
with a brigade of dragoons, I remember seeing whole
fields of wheat, &amp;c., cut down and given as green
food to the horses of our army. The French being
expected almost immediately to occupy the position
we were then in, the commanding officer very properly
thought it better to secure the grain for
ourselves than leave it to fall into the hands of the
enemy. A poor old Spaniard came up to the gallant
colonel, the late Sir Felton Harvey, and, shaking his
grey locks, implored him to spare his only field, which
was to preserve himself and family from starving,
and which he beheld our troops cutting to feed their
horses. The reply was that we were his friends; that
we were obliged to take the corn, since our horses
must not starve; that, if they did not eat it, those of
the French, his mortal enemies, would. The colonel
concluded by giving the poor man an order on the
commissary to pay him in dollars equal to what had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
been taken away. I give this anecdote for the edification
of such of my countrymen as are apt, through
ignorance, let us hope, to malign the conduct of our
soldiers in the Peninsula, and who grudge the officers
and men of both army and navy their hard-earned
half-pay or pension, a return surely not more than
sufficient for averting the horrors of war from the
hearths of their fellow subjects.</p>

<p>The constant state of alarm and anxiety that the
whole of Spain and Portugal suffered while the contending
armies were hovering about was extreme. As
long as the British troops occupied their towns and
villages, the poor inhabitants knew they had nothing
to fear; but the moment the French came, plunder
and destruction were the order of the day, and in very
many cases, outrages were committed through mere
wantonness: houses unroofed, the sides of others stove
in, and the furniture destroyed. Our soldiers were the
“lion and the lamb”; those of the French, to use
Voltaire’s expression, the “tiger and the monkey.”</p>

<p>I was informed at Villa Vicosa, by a genteel Portuguese
family, of the continual fear they lived in, and
they related to me the following circumstance:&mdash;One
night the alarm was given that the French were advancing
into the town, nearly every person having
gone to bed. Immediately all the church bells began
tolling to give warning; everyone, even the sick, arose,
these latter were put into cars, each person taking
what things he could carry with him&mdash;one a bed,
another articles of clothing, chairs, tables, or whatever
else might be useful in their hiding places. After they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
had gone a short distance, it was found to be only a
false alarm. An enemy’s foraging party had been
seen during the evening in the neighbourhood, but
had, fortunately for them, taken another direction. At
this period our troops were in the north of Portugal,
and the French having a strong garrison in Badajoz,
used to send out occasionally a marauding party,
which caused the above consternation!</p>

<p>We left Vemiero on the 23rd July, and arrived at
Estramoy the same day. It is rather a large inland
town, and once had been a garrison, the works of the
fortifications remained, but the guns had been removed,
the city being commanded by an eminence at
the back of it still higher than the hill on which it is
built. Unlike most other towns in Portugal, it is
tolerably clean. On the following morning we marched
from hence to a pretty neat little village called
O’Rodondo, where we arrived at ten, and I had the
pleasure of once more meeting my brother, who had
just recovered from a sabre cut in his face, received at
the battles of Fuentes d’Onor, which knocked out
two of his teeth and split his tongue.</p>

<p>Since we had parted in the year 1804 on the peaceful
shores of England, what trials and scenes had we
both gone through and witnessed. He had been on
the expedition under Sir Samuel Achmuty, at the
taking of Monte Video, in South America; in four
general actions; the two bloody days of Talavera in
1809; the battle of the Coa, Busaco, Fuentes d’Onor,
where he was wounded, besides several warm affairs
and skirmishes; and since then he was in the battles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
of Llerena, Salamanca, Vittoria, Pyrenees, Orthes,
Toulouse, and numerous outpost affairs.</p>

<p>He has lately been sent with Lord William Russell
as one of the Lieut.-Colonels employed by our Government
as military reporters when Don Pedro returned
to Portugal, the events of which period he has
published in his “rough leaves.” He at present commands
the 15th Hussars, and is with his regiment at
Madras, having sailed from Gravesend, with the headquarters
of his regiment, on board the <i>Herefordshire</i>,
East Indiaman, on the 4th of June, 1839.</p>

<p>I, too, had been tried in fire at Trafalgar, and
on various boat expeditions, etc., and had been
wounded, and taken prisoner.</p>

<p>We remained at O’Rodondo three days, during
which time I rode with my brother to various places
in the neighbourhood. On the 28th of July, the
regiment moved to Villa Vicosa, where we found some
fine infantry regiments preparing for a march to the
northward to invest Ciudad Rodrigo.</p>

<p>I liked Villa Vicosa much better than any other
town I had yet seen in Portugal, the inhabitants were
very civil, and I was introduced to several families,
and did hope we should remain here for some days;
the country round about it was pleasant, and a park
full of deer, belonging to the Prince Regent, used to
furnish us occasionally with venison. Those officers
who had a regency certificate had permission to shoot
in it.</p>

<p>Operations against Ciudad Rodrigo having been
determined upon, we only remained here three days,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
during which time I visited Elvas, Borba, Alandroal,
and other places. From Elvas, I had a very good view
of Badajoz, with the river Guadiana, and the surrounding
flat country. The town and fortifications of Elvas
are well worth seeing, they are on a large scale, and
built on a high hill. This being one of the principal
frontier towns of Portugal, great pains had been taken
by Count Le Lippe<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> to render the works as strong as
possible. After he had completed the fortifications,
he found it necessary to erect a strong fortress or
castle, on a high hill, which commanded the best part
of them, and which is considered so strong, that it is
supposed to be impregnable; it is named after himself.
Report says that a garrison of 15,000 men in Elvas,
and 1200 in Fort Le Lippe, with plenty of provisions,
would keep those places in defiance of any numbers
that might be brought against them.</p>

<p>There is at Elvas a very large, fine, and curious
aqueduct, differing from any I had yet seen: it has
three tiers of arches, raised one above the other, and
of great height.</p>

<p>The French army having made a movement to
the northward, orders arrived in the evening for the
14th Dragoons to march at daylight the next morning
for Estramoy, where they halted for the night. Next
day they moved forward to Frontiera, and from thence
to O’Crato, where are the remains of an old Moorish
castle. We left this town on the morning of the 5th
of August, and on our arrival at the miserable village<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
of Gafete, my leave of absence having expired, I was
obliged, to my great sorrow, to return to Lisbon. So,
bidding my brother and friends of the regiment adieu,
I struck off for Abrantes, thirty miles distant.</p>

<p>Colonel Hervey very kindly sent a dragoon to escort
me thither, the road being rendered dangerous by
marauding parties of the natives. I was now mounted
upon a nice little French horse. He had belonged to
the French 1st Hussars, and had been taken from the
enemy in a charge by my brother’s troop. I reached
Abrantes by five in the evening, and, having got a
tolerable billet and something to eat, was glad to go
to rest.</p>

<p>At ten the next morning I quitted Abrantes alone,
the soldier having gone back to his regiment, which
was ordered to cover the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo.</p>

<p>I had still eighty-four miles to ride to Lisbon, which
was not very pleasant to do alone at that period, considering
the excited state and wretched poverty of the
country.</p>

<p>At sunset I arrived at Santarem, thirty-six miles
from Abrantes. This latter is a large, dirty town,
standing upon a hill that commands the country
around it. The river Tagus runs at its foot, over
which is a bridge of boats that can be removed at
pleasure. The French marshal, Junot, derived his
title from this city.</p>

<p>At Santarem I picked up an English soldier, who
undertook the care of my horse. This is a large
town. Part of it is built on a high hill: the remainder
standing in a valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>When here last year the French committed great
devastation, unroofing some of the houses, and staving
in the sides of others, besides plundering and destroying
whatever they could lay their hands on.</p>

<p>My billet had been unroofed, and part of its sides
were torn down. I found a mattrass spread on the
floor, but without the necessary accompaniment of
clothes. The fleas, as is usual in such places, were
exceedingly troublesome; but, having ridden all day
under a hot sun, sleep soon overcame this annoyance,
and I remained unconscious of their attacks till seven
the next morning, when I arose, and, after taking a
refreshing swim in the Tagus in order to get rid of
my lively bed-fellows, ate my breakfast, and then
rode to Villa Franca, twenty-four miles. The heat
of the weather being very great, and my horse loaded
with my saddle bags, it was impossible for me to
go faster than a walk, so that it was evening before I
reached that place.</p>

<p>In the course of the day I passed through several
small villages that the French had nearly destroyed.
The inhabitants were beginning to return and put the
remains of their houses in order.</p>

<p>At Villa Franca I got a tolerably good dinner, but
was almost talked to death by the landlady, an Irishwoman,
at whose house I had put up, and who
inquired the news of the army&mdash;what they were
about&mdash;whither going&mdash;where such a regiment was,
&amp;c., &amp;c., forgetting that I was tired and wanted rest.</p>

<p>Early next morning I left for Lisbon, and, after a
ride of six hours, passing by part of the lines of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
Torres Vedras, at which men were still working,
I reached that city.</p>

<p>I had ridden, for the first time in my life, more
than five hundred miles, and nearly the whole of it
in the sun during the hottest part of the day, in the
months of July and August, without its doing me
the least harm, and never feeling over fatigued.</p>

<p class="summary">Lisbon, Cintra, Mafra, etc., 1811, 1812&mdash;Second trip to the Army&mdash;Taking
of Badajoz.</p>

<p class="p2">I spent the remainder of the year in the Tagus,
making, when duty permitted, excursions up that
river to some of the small islands, near Alhandra,
where we used to find snipe, quail, and other wild
fowl. Sometimes we landed on the south side of the
Tagus, to shoot red-legged partridges and woodcocks,
which we occasionally met with near the Prince’s
Quinta. But the most delightful place for snipe and
wild fowl was Loares, on the road towards Torres
Vedras: the swamps being there alive with various
kinds of them, and amongst others, bittern, kites,
hawks, and I have seen, now and then, an osprey.</p>

<p>In March, 1812, I made a very pleasant excursion
to Cintra, Mafra, and Colares, with the present Lord
By&mdash;&mdash;, and some other officers of the <i>Barfleur</i>.
On our road, we went to see the palace of Calous,
where, in some of the rooms are, very well painted,
the whole of the adventures of Don Quixote.</p>

<p>Cintra, fifteen miles distant from Lisbon, is situated
on the north-east side of the rock. It is certainly one
of the most romantic places I have seen, and commands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
an extensive and beautiful view of the country and of
the sea. The buildings most worthy of observation
are: first, the Penia convent, rising from the rock of
Lisbon; it is about three hundred and twenty years’
old, and is tenanted by three monks. From hence is
a fine prospect, comprising Cape Espichel, Peniche,
and the Burling islands. Another convent, called the
Cork, from its being lined with that wood, built also
on the rock, and having fifteen monks for its inmates,
next attracts attention. This was founded about
three hundred years ago. Beyond, on an extreme
point of the rock, are the ruins of a Moorish castle,
mosque, prison, and baths: the latter supposed by
some to be of Roman origin. The Marquess of
Marialva’s palace, where the convention was signed,
is very fine, and pleasantly situated.</p>

<p>Rising amongst rocks, and embosomed in orange,
lemon, and pomegranate trees, Penia Verde must not
pass unnoticed. Its original possessor, Don Juan de
Castro, who died <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1723, and whose remains, at
his request, were interred in a particular spot in the
garden, discovered much of the interior of Brazil:
besides being of great use to the Government in
several important matters. On his return to Lisbon
he petitioned for a pension, which being most ungratefully
refused, he so willed his property and
possessions as to prevent them in any way benefiting
his country, which had turned a deaf ear to his claims
for compensation for the services he had rendered her.
This fact our guide adduced as a reason for the grounds
being found in their wild and neglected condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>The king’s palace, an old gloomy edifice, did not
much take my fancy. What most struck me there
was a shower-bath, lined with white marble, or,
perhaps, pantiles, and which, on turning a pipe, throws
the water in all directions. It not unfrequently
happened that visitors were taught a practical lesson
of its powers. It used to be a joke to get them to
step into the bath room, the machinery was put in
motion, and they underwent a good drenching as the
reward of their curiosity.</p>

<p>The prince’s palace of Romalyan I thought pretty,
and its situation, looking towards Lisbon and the sea,
quite delightful. The Marquis of Marialva has other
gardens than those adjoining his palace, which we
went to see, on account of the figures they contain;
amongst them are shoemakers, and an old woman
spinning, all as large as life; by touching some wires
they are set in motion and immediately begin their
work.</p>

<p>We one day rode to the village of Colares, prettily
situated near the sea, and famous for its wine, which
is so excellent that I am surprised it is not more
frequently met with in England; it is something in
flavour between claret and burgundy.</p>

<p>In the garden of a Signor Tomazine, at the above
place, is a mineral spring, but I am ignorant of its
qualities. Would not this afford a capital speculation
to an M.D. Let me advise one to analyse the spring,
rent it&mdash;write a pamphlet upon its good qualities&mdash;recommend
it strongly for the cure of all kinds of
complaints, particularly consumptions and pulmonary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
affections. The fine beautiful air of Cintra, and its
romantic scenery he could always call in to his aid as
a good and faithful ally in all extreme cases; and
when he occasionally failed, he might say the case
was desperate, and the patient’s time was come. With
the assistance above mentioned, he would be sure to
effect some cures, and make his fortune; steam vessels
would bring him patients and friends to attend them,
some of the latter would probably in time fall sick,
and, therefore, he might justly calculate upon getting
a few of them also on his books as patients. I hope,
should any medical gentleman take this hint, he will
remember me gratefully in his will, for depend upon
it, the speculation will answer much better than many
of the railroads.</p>

<p>Before leaving Cintra, on our return to Lisbon, we
made an excursion to Mafra to see an eminent building,
containing, besides a convent and church, a palace
for the king, and another for the queen. I believe
that, with the exception of the Escurial in Spain, this
is the largest pile of building in Europe. I was told
that in one quadrangle alone, the French, previous to
the convention, had quartered 15,000 men. From the
roof is a fine view of the country for many miles.
There is also a topada, or park, of some extent,
belonging to it. From the church rises a dome, something
like that of St. Paul’s in London. There are
likewise two steeples. The interior, which contains
some good paintings, and several pieces of sculpture
in alto-relief, on scriptural subjects, is well worth inspection.
These were executed at Rome, and showed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
the hand of a great master. There are also statues of
all the saints, in white marble. Its six organs are considered
very fine, and according to the padres, the
Mafra ring of bells is the best in the world. This
palace, at the time we saw it, was the depôt for the
formation of the Portuguese army.</p>

<p>I have not dwelt much on Lisbon, a city so generally
known, that to notice its public buildings, aqueduct,
etc., would be superfluous in a narrative like the
present. We had a few slight shocks of an earthquake
during the time I was there, which created a little
alarm, and caused all the church bells to be set ringing
for the people to come to mass.</p>

<p>On the 16th of March I had permission to accompany
my brother to his regiment, which was then at
Olivença, in Spain, covering the siege of Badajoz.
Our route to the army was the same as before, through
the Alemtejo to Elvas; we crossed the river Guadiana
by the ford of Xerumaha to Olivença, in Estramadura,
where the regiment remained until the 4th of April.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult having advanced towards Badajoz to
try and raise the siege, the cavalry, both heavy and
light, were sent forward as far as Villaloa, Almandralajo,
and Villa Franca, to oppose him; some brigades
of infantry occupying Albuera on nearly the same
spot where Lord Beresford fought the battle.</p>

<p>I remained behind to see the siege, and pay a visit
to my old friends of the 7th Fusiliers, with a Captain
Daniel Capel, of the 14th. On the 5th of April I
went with them to look at the breaching batteries,
and to visit an old acquaintance, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>
wounded the day before by a musket-ball through the
side, while doing duty as an engineer in the trenches.
Poor fellow! he was afterwards killed on the Pyrenees
by lightning; he belonged to the 37th Regiment. I
spent a very pleasant day with the Fusiliers, but it was
doomed alas! to be the last with several of my gallant
friends, and amongst others, poor Saint Pol, who the
next night was mortally wounded at the storming of
the large breach.</p>

<p>On my return, late in the evening, to my quarters at
Olivença, what with the haze in my head, occasioned
by wine, the foggy state of the evening, the smoke
from the fire of the different batteries, the captain of
dragoons and myself lost each other, and our way.
By mistake my horse, who had been taken from the
enemy, took the wrong road, and instead of going to
the left, towards a ford that we had to cross at some
distance in rear of the camp, he chose to take me to
the foot of the bridge leading to Badajoz, where the
enemy had a cavalry picket; fortunately for me, we
had a strong covering party of the 43rd Regiment
lying down on the ground. Being unable to give the
countersign, these were going to shoot me for a French
officer. They seized my steed, and knocked me off
his back with the butt end of a musket. I was dragged
on the ground back to the camp, where I had to encounter
the jokes of my friends, softened it is true by
sincere congratulations on my escape. My horse,
whose head had been turned from Badajoz, got loose,
and managed to find his way back to Olivença, where
I was <i>lucky</i> enough to find him the next day; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
sometimes lost horses were borrowed to carry baggage,
commissary stores, or other articles, and they undergoing
various metamorphoses, such as cropping the
ears and tails, with other little changes in their appearances,
the lawful owners could with great difficulty
recognise their own steeds.</p>

<p>These slight-of-hand tricks used occasionally to be
played; and with an army consisting of so many
thousand troops, composed of various nations, and
covering a vast extent of country, it was not a very
easy matter to trace a lost animal, whether horse,
mule, or donkey.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 6th, Badajoz was stormed
and taken. <i>No other troops in the world</i> could have
carried a citadel so strong, and so manfully defended;
they behaved most <i>nobly</i>, in spite of death and destruction,
which were dealt around with <i>no sparing
hand</i>.</p>

<p>Our army was indeed a gallant band of warriors,
such as we shall never see again; such as the world
probably will never again produce.</p>

<p>Having rejoined the 14th Dragoons at Valverde, I
proceeded with them to the several towns of Almendrab,
Santa Martha, Villalva, Villa Franca, Fuente de
Meastro, Rebeiro, and nearly to Usagre. Marshal
Soult pushed forward his cavalry, and some outpost
skirmishing took place. Near Villa Franca, the 12th,
14th, and 16th Light Dragoons, with six regiments of
heavy horse, having joined and drawn up, we expected
a general cavalry action. It passed over, however,
with some skirmishing in front with a numerous body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
of the enemy’s dragoons, who manœuvred to cover the
retreat of their army.</p>

<p>I recollect one of Soult’s scouts, a Spaniard, being
taken by a patrol of the 14th Dragoons. This fellow
was observed stealing, under cover of night, in the
direction of our pickets, when he was seized and
brought in. Being threatened with instant death
unless he gave up his despatch, he fell on his knees
and implored for mercy, directing the officer to cut
the third leather button from his coat, when he would
find what he demanded. On taking off the button,
a tiny slip of paper was discovered, on which was
written these words, “Hold out: I am coming.” I
saw this <i>morceau</i>; it was short and to the purpose.
It had been sent by the marshal to the governor of
Badajoz.</p>

<p>My leave of absence having expired, I was obliged
to return towards Lisbon. I had been all day with
my brother on the advanced picket, looking at our
videttes and those of the French, near Usagre, when,
having laid down in my clothes to get a little rest,
orders arrived to again advance. No engagement,
however, being expected, I was advised to remain
where I was for the night, and to set out in the
morning on my route for the Tagus.</p>

<p>Next day, whilst quietly retracing my steps thither,
a brilliant cavalry affair took place near the above-named
town and Llerena, when the French were
completely routed, and many prisoners made. I was
sorry I had not remained to witness the rencontre, but
consoled myself with the reflection that I had pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>bably
been saved a broken head, where I should have
gained neither credit nor thanks.</p>

<p>The second day after leaving the army I reached
Badajoz, and went over the defences of that city,
which bore strongly the marks of recent strife. Not
the least affecting evidence of mortal affray were the
bodies of several of my gallant countrymen floating
in the ditch, and which people were employed in
removing in order to their being buried. The more I
examined the works, the greater my astonishment at
the bravery and perseverance of our troops. By one
unacquainted with military tactics, time alone would
have been pronounced capable of effecting the ruin
before him. He could never have conceived it possible
that walls so apparently impregnable would
have yielded to the force of a besieging army. But
for the escalade, indeed, failure had been inevitable
where success was now complete, insured as it had
been by immense sacrifice of life.</p>

<p>My road from Badajoz lay through Olivença, where
I crossed the river Guadiana to Xerumaha, and proceeded
thence to Villa Vicosa and San Miguel de
Mechada, where I fell in with some French prisoners
marching, under a strong escort, to Lisbon. They
had formed part of a division, under General Girard,
when he was surprised and routed by the gallant Sir
Rowland Hill near Miranda.</p>

<p>The fifth day brought me to Evora, where, announcing
to the inhabitants glad tidings of victory, I got an
excellent billet at the house of a padre, who gave me
the best dinner and bed I had had for some time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>Evora, the capital of the Alemtejo, is a fine old
town, and has still visible the remains of a Roman
wall. Here, too, is the aqueduct, built by the General
Sertorius, which is in tolerable repair after the lapse
of so many ages. This place is fortified, and contains
an episcopal palace.</p>

<p>Time pressing, I set forward the next morning, my
friend, the priest, having obtained an order from the
Juis de Fori for a muleteer to attend me, and convey
my baggage on a mule. The fellow turned rather
sulky, so much so that I was obliged to drive him on
with my pistol to Vendas Novas, where, after a hot
ride of thirty-six miles, I had to sit up all night to
guard my baggage and prevent the rascal running
away, such I had been informed being his intention
the moment I had gone to bed. The window of my
room looking into the street, I told my friend that if
he attempted to escape I would shoot him on the
spot. This had the desired effect, and next morning
I proceeded, still driving the Spaniard on before me,
to that dirty place, Pegoeus, where, falling in with a
party of English soldiers, I gave him in charge to
them.</p>

<p>The following day I arrived, after a ride of five
hours, at Aldea Galega, where, dismissing my muleteer,
who made many humble apologies for his behaviour,
I embarked in the ferry-boat, and crossed over to
Lisbon. The fellow, it appeared, was fearful of being
again pressed at Aldea Galega into the service of the
commissaries to carry stores or provisions to the
army.</p>

<p class="summary">Cadiz, Minorca, Majorca, Alicant, Carthagena, Algiers, Oran, Altea
Bay&mdash;Drive a French Privateer on shore near Denia.</p>

<p class="p2">On the 13th of June I sailed in H.M. Ship <i>Brune</i> for
Cadiz, at that time besieged by Marshal Soult. I
waited on Admiral Legg, and our ambassador (Sir
Henry Willesley), and delivered my despatches, and,
after remaining there two days, proceeded to Gibraltar
and Minorca, where I was placed under the orders
of Rear-Admiral Benjamin Hallowell, who, on the
4th July, sent me to Palma Bay, Majorca, to collect
Spanish troops, and embark them on board transports
and the <i>Brune</i>. After making two or three trips
between the two above-named islands, I embarked
Major-General Whittingham’s brigade of Spanish
troops, who were not a bad-looking body of men.</p>

<p>I dined occasionally with his Excellency the
Governor-General of the Balearic islands, the Marquis
de Coupigny, who was a very pleasant, gentlemanly
person, and at whose table I met several of the
Spanish <i>noblesse</i>, who had taken refuge at Palma
during the troubles on the continent.</p>

<p>I observed that smoking was not uncommon with
the Spanish ladies. Whence this custom originated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span>
it is perhaps difficult to determine, unless, indeed, the
habit of using tobacco&mdash;to which the other sex are
immoderately addicted&mdash;has gradually, from social
motives, been adopted by the fair; for we can hardly
suppose that a practice so generally reprobated by
them should at once be resorted to by ladies as a
recreation, or even solace. The compliment, if such
it be, ought to be duly appreciated by their husbands.
But what will not woman do or suffer to conduce to
the comfort or to mitigate the care of him she loves!</p>

<p>In Spain are to be seen beautiful women in every
rank of life, with very fine eyes, pretty feet and
hands. They generally carry a fan&mdash;a most useful
auxiliary whilst conversing; indeed, they would be
hardly able to talk without one. Their dress is calculated
to set off a good figure and fine features to
great advantage.</p>

<p>After embarking the brigade of General Whittingham,
we proceeded to Alicant. The castle and fortress
of this place make a figure in history, particularly
during the war of succession, and bring to remembrance
the brave and chivalric conduct of the Earl of
Peterborough. The anchorage in the bay is good,
and, with a long scope of cable, ships may ride out a
heavy gale with the wind in, for the under-tow is so
great that you ride with little strain on the cables.</p>

<p>After the battle of Salamanca, Soult, thinking his
situation before Cadiz insecure, raised the siege, and
retired into the interior; but it being doubtful whether
he might not make a dash at Carthagena, Rear-Admiral
Sir Sidney Smith proceeded thither from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span>
Gibraltar in the <i>Tremendous</i> (74), to communicate
with the general commanding our army at Alicant
and Rear-Admiral Hallowell on the subject. I was,
therefore, sent thither with two Spanish regiments,
embarked on board transports, to be ready to act in
case of necessity, but with orders on no account to
land the troops, unless the place was threatened, as a
bad periodical yellow fever was raging in the town
with great violence. The gallant admiral (Sir Sidney
Smith), however, would take me on shore to show me
the best places to plant cannon and take up position
in case of attack. After this, we must go to the
hospital to inquire into the nature of the fever, &amp;c.
Every now and then he gave me a pinch of snuff,
telling me not to swallow my saliva, and there would
be no danger of catching the disease. In the course
of a week I was attacked by fever, but, being in the
outer roadstead, the fresh air probably prevented its
attaining that malignancy it had reached in the town,
but it was some weeks before I perfectly recovered.</p>

<p>The <i>Tremendous</i> (74), with the admiral, sailed the
day after our visit to the city to join the fleet off
Toulon. Several other men-of-war arrived in the
course of a few days with more troops from headquarters.
Whether Soult was deterred by the sickness
prevailing in the place, or had heard of the
reinforcements, he passed on his route, and we all
returned to Alicant.</p>

<p>Shortly after, I was sent to Altea Bay, to lie there
and protect any transports that might arrive to procure
water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>During my stay there the French sent a detachment
of three hundred infantry and a squadron of cavalry
from Denia to forage and levy contributions. Having
only my own ship’s company&mdash;which altogether, men
and boys, amounted to only one hundred and forty&mdash;it
was impossible for me to land and fight them, but
by making a show with our boats, and firing a few
shots, we dislodged them from the town, and prevented
their plundering it or getting any contributions
from the inhabitants. They succeeded, however, in
our neighbourhood, and in the course of a couple
of days collected a quantity of forage, &amp;c., and retired
upon Denia.</p>

<p>Within one day’s march of Altea was a Spanish
division of troops, to whom I immediately sent the
moment intelligence of the enemy’s intention of paying
us a visit reached me.</p>

<p>The officer I dispatched got to them the same
evening, and returned back the following morning,
three hours before the arrival of the enemy. The
Spaniards, with their usual alertness, sent two regiments&mdash;about
twelve hundred men&mdash;<i>exactly five days</i>
after the French had retired.</p>

<p>On the 8th of December, 1812, a convoy of transports
were placed under my orders to proceed to
Oran, on the coast of Barbary, to procure corn and
bullocks for the army and navy, but heavy gales
from the S.W. obliged us to run into the bay of
Algiers, where we remained about a fortnight.</p>

<p>Our consul, Mr. MacDonald, was extremely civil,
and occasionally I slept at his country house, a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>
miles out of the town; but being unaccustomed to the
noise of the jackals that came nightly to the very
walls of his yard in search of food, I was frequently
disturbed by them.</p>

<p>The Dey of Algiers ordered us a daily supply of
fresh provisions and vegetables. On my departure
I proffered my services to take whatever his Highness
might have to send to his servant, the Bey of Oran.
He thanked me, through our consul, and requested
me to take a stone coffin for the Bey’s son, which I
delivered safe. The Dey was so much indisposed
during my stay that I was unable to obtain an
audience. We had a great deal of saluting&mdash;twenty-one
guns on anchoring&mdash;twenty-one guns on landing;
three guns whenever he sent off his present of fresh
meat and vegetables, which latter was considered in
the light of three salaams.</p>

<p>After a passage of two days from Algiers, we
reached the fine, safe bay of Marsalquiver, three miles
from the town of Oran, where all ships anchor in
winter, it being nearly land-locked.</p>

<p>No time was lost in having an interview with the
Bey, who was civil; but I had a long discussion
previously with his guards, who refused me admittance
to his presence unless I took off my boots,
and employed menaces to enforce their demands.
However, finding me obstinate, and our vice-consul,
who was a Spaniard, telling them I had come from
Algiers with a present from his Highness the Dey,
they permitted me to pass, and I never was troubled
afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>The Bey was a venerable-looking man, of about
sixty-five years of age, thin, and of middle stature, with
a fine, long, white beard, hard features, but a scowl
upon his countenance that showed he could, when he
thought proper, play the tiger.</p>

<p>He promised the supplies I requested in ten days,
said he wished to be on the best terms with the
English, and thanked me for bringing the stone coffin
for his son’s tomb; gave me coffee without sugar, and
a pipe to smoke, and appeared much amused with
my awkward manner of sitting cross-legged like a
Turk.</p>

<p>He was surrounded by his principal officers, in
full dress, with silver-gilt swords and pistols in their
girdles.</p>

<p>The admiral or captain of the port was a handsome,
mild, gentlemanly person. The old Bey, the morning
of my arrival, had been administering summary justice,
for on my going into the market-place I saw three ill-looking
Moors hanging by the neck. It is not the
fashion in Barbary to place caps over the criminals’
faces before they are executed. Upon inquiring what
those three wretches had been doing, the vice-consul
gave me the following account:&mdash;“A Moorish merchant,
with a special passport from the Bey, had
permission to travel into the interior to traffic, when
he and his party were waylaid on the mountains,
robbed, and all, except one, murdered. The person
who escaped immediately informed the proper
authorities, who reported it to the Bey. A body
of troops was instantly sent to the mountains, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
arrested all the chiefs of the tribes, and brought them
before his Highness. He, looking at them sternly,
said, ‘On such a day a merchant from my city, with
my passport, was murdered and robbed on the mountains.
If in three days from this time you do not
bring before me the whole of the offenders, your own
heads shall answer for it. Begone!’ In less than
forty-eight hours eleven fellows were brought in, and
led directly to the palace. The Bey demanded who
committed the murder. Three men were pointed out.
They did not deny it. ‘Very well,’ said the Bey,
‘take these men, and instantly hang them up in the
market-place.’ Three others, who had been most
active in plundering, had their right hands cut off,
and the remaining five received each from three to
five hundred bastinadoes on the soles of their feet.”
The third evening, at sunset, the murderers were cut
down and buried.</p>

<p>They have a very expeditious way of staunching
the blood after amputation. The stumps of the arms
are plunged into a kind of boiling pitch, which has
the effect of searing the arteries. Over this is placed a
dressing and bladder, when the sufferers are turned out.</p>

<p>I used to go occasionally, with our vice-consul and
some of my own officers, out shooting. We always
found the people tolerably civil&mdash;except the boys,
who used to abuse and spit at us, calling us, amongst
other names, Christian dogs. Now and then we got
a shove and a sly stone.</p>

<p>Coming home one evening from an excursion to a
small lake, about sixteen miles distant, where we had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
been for the purpose of shooting flamingos, &amp;c., we
got into a serious scrape, owing to a young commissary
having taken his servant, a Portuguese boy,
with him, who did not understand managing a horse.</p>

<p>We had ridden fast across the country from the
lake to get back before the gates of Oran were shut,
which they always were at sunset, when, just as we
were entering the town and trotting on, we met a
party of Turkish and Moorish boys, who tried to
frighten our horses by throwing up their loose garments
in the animals’ faces, and making a great noise.
All our horses stood this, except the one on which
the servant boy was mounted, which reared up, and,
dashing forward, knocked down with his fore feet one
of the young Turks who had been most forward in
the mischief. His head was a good deal cut, and
bled profusely. We should have said he was very justly
served. Not so the Moors and Kabiles. A hue and
cry was instantly raised, and we were followed by a
mob, demanding the life of the poor Portuguese for
having, he being a Christian, drawn the blood of a true
follower of the prophet. Pushing on to the vice-consul’s,
we jumped off our horses, shoved in the
young Portuguese, and locked and barricaded the
doors. The Moors and Kabiles surrounded the house,
making a great clamour, insisting that the servant
should be immediately given up and put to death.
Nothing but their fear of the English prevented them
breaking into the place. We hoisted our colours
on the flagstaff at the consul’s house, when it was
considered a fortress, and respected accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>In a city like Oran, where each man is a spy on
his neighbour, the news was fortunately not long in
reaching the ears of the Bey, who, on the first
intimation of the danger that threatened the consul’s
residence, sent down a party of troops, with the
captain of the port, to restore order, and act as
circumstances might require. Some management was
necessary to get the captain of the port into the
house, as also to keep out the Moors, who, had they
laid hold of the boy, would certainly have murdered
him.</p>

<p>We at length succeeded, and then explained that,
returning from shooting, we had ridden full trot into
the town in order to get home before the gates were
closed at sunset, clearly showing that but for the
boys frightening our horses no harm could possibly
have happened. He said that he did not in the least
doubt the truth of our story, but should the boy die,&mdash;accidents
not being provided against in their code of
laws,&mdash;nothing short of the death of the Portuguese
lad would appease the populace, since blood, and
Turkish blood, too, had been spilt.</p>

<p>I proposed putting on my uniform and attending
the vice-consul and captain of the port to the palace,
which was done. Passing through the crowd was not
very agreeable, but, under the protection of a guard,
we reached our destination in safety.</p>

<p>The old Bey laid down the Moorish law with great
clearness, arguing the point calmly, and evidently
with a friendly feeling towards us.</p>

<p>He had been making enquiries, he said, and had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span>
found our account of the transaction to be quite
correct; that he knew the Turkish boy was a great
rascal, and though he had been rightly served, it
would be difficult to pacify the Moors, especially since
the offender was not an Englishman. “True,” I replied;
“but he is a subject of our ally, and under my protection,
and nothing but extreme necessity shall
compel me to give him up.” “Keep him out of sight,”
replied his Highness, “and never again let eyes be cast
on him in this place, or I will not be answerable for
his life. Come here to-morrow.”</p>

<p>We returned to the consul’s, and the captain of the
port dispersed the mob, assuring them the Bey would
take care that justice was done. With the morning’s
dawn again came our clamorous foes; but having in
the meantime had communication, through our friend
the captain of the port, with the boy’s parents, we had
learned there was no fear of the young Turk dying,
who, though he had received a severe cut and some
bruises, was doing well. A hint, too, was given us
that a few dollars would assist to heal the wound and
soften the rigour of justice. We went early next
morning to the palace, when the Bey informed us of
what we already knew, that the boy would not die
from the injuries he had sustained. Then entering
into conversation, “Consider,” said he, “if a like event
had happened to you in a town in England? You
knew it was wrong to ride fast near a populous town.”
We pleaded our apprehensions of being locked out all
night. “You ought to have come home sooner then;
but to return to my first question. If in your own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span>
country such an accident had happened, what would
be the consequence?” I replied that we should have
had to pay the doctor’s bill, and in the case of a poor
person to give something extra to the parents for the
loss of time in nursing him. “Very well, then, you
shall do the same here; but, take my advice, never
ride fast through a large town again, and smuggle
your Portuguese off to the ships for fear of accident;”
which I did the earliest opportunity. The Bey then
said, “Who furnished you with horses?” The vice-consul
informed him. “What! my slave? they were
mine, and the fellow had let them to you without my
leave; he has been the cause of the whole. Here,”&mdash;clapping
his hands, that an officer might come,&mdash;“go
directly and give my groom five hundred bastinadoes
for letting out my horses without asking my permission.”
Making our bows we retired, when just outside
the door we met Achmet the groom in the hands of
two fierce looking Moorish officers of justice, taking
him to the market-place to undergo his punishment.
He fell on his knees, and implored us to ask his
master to pardon him. We stopped the officers of
vengeance, and after a little solicitation, the Bey listened
to our request, and the man was pardoned, who,
when he met us, wanted to kiss our feet for saving
him from being bastinadoed. I believe the fellow was
a rogue, who intended to pocket the money, thinking
his master would not find him out. Thus ended the
affair, the commissary paying sixty Spanish dollars to
the mother of the young vagabond.</p>

<p>Having embarked our supplies for the army, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
returned to Alicant with the convoy, and the 21st of
January, 1813, proceeded to Gibraltar to refit, where
we remained three weeks, and then rejoined Rear-Admiral
Hallowell, who sent us to our old station in
Altea Bay,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> and from thence to cruize off Denia, near
which place we drove a French felucca privateer on
shore, mounting two brass nine-pounders and swivels,
with small arms, and bilged her. Our next destination
was another trip to Oran, on the coast of Barbary,
with four transports, for cattle and corn. We had a
capital run there and back with our live cargo.</p>

Veniros; upset in a boat&mdash;Valencia&mdash;Holland.</p>

<p class="p2">Towards the end of May, 1813, embarking 300 men
of the 67th Regiment, under Colonel Prevost, an officer
who had distinguished himself at the battle of Barrosa,
we sailed with the expedition from Alicant to lay siege
to the castle of the Col de Balaguer and the city of
Tarragona. The land forces, under the command of
Lieut.-General Sir John Murray, consisted of about
20,000 men, but, unfortunately, not more than 5000
were British and Germans, the rest being Spaniards
and Sicilians. The naval part was under the orders
of that intelligent and indefatigable officer, Rear-Admiral
Benjamin Hallowell.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of June, when off the castle of the Col
de Balaguer, the whole of the 67th Regiment, with
Rolle’s and Dillon’s, and a company of artillery,
making together about 900 men, were ordered to
invest it. The navy was placed under the command
of the gallant Captain Charles Adams, of the <i>Invincible</i>
(74), by whose great exertions the troops, guns, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>
stores were soon landed, and who personally superintended
every difficult and dangerous undertaking
during the siege. Captain Carroll, of the <i>Volcano</i>,
was landed to assist troops, and a more intrepid and
excellent officer could not have been selected.</p>

<p>The fortress was situated on a high hill, in a most
difficult pass, through which winds the main road from
Tortosa to Tarragona. It was armed with twelve
heavy pieces, two ten-inch mortars, two howitzers, and
had a garrison of more than a hundred men. Its
elevated position, and surrounding heights, difficult of
access, required the greatest labour to drag up the
guns and mortars necessary to establish our batteries.
No time, however, was to be lost; Marshal Suchet, with
10,000 men, being in full march from the neighbourhood
of Valencia to relieve it, and succour Tarragona.</p>

<p>After a siege of five days the place surrendered.
I had the pleasure of assisting, with a party of seamen,
to form the mortar battery, which was no sooner
opened than the shells were thrown with such precision
by the artillery that an expense magazine was blown
up in the castle, which, just as our breaching battery
was about to open, capitulated. An artilleryman and
myself had a most providential escape. Being very
busy placing sand bags on the battery, on the morning
of the 8th, just before day-break, down came three of
the enemy’s shells. I ordered the working party to
get behind the sand bags, and lie flat on their faces to
avoid the splinters. One shell from an howitzer exploded
behind us; two ten-inch followed, one fell about
a couple of yards in front of me and the artilleryman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
which made us both jump to get out of its way, when
down came the second on the other side of us. The
man called out very coolly&mdash;“I’ll be d&mdash;&mdash; if we are
not done now!” After falling on the ground both fuses
went out, and, much to our satisfaction, the shells, of
course, did not explode.</p>

<p>Captain Stodart, of the <i>Strombolo</i>, a brave officer,
was employed to form the breaching battery, and
Lieutenants Corbyn and P&mdash;&mdash;, of H.M.S. <i>Invincible</i>,
worked like slaves with their party to drag the heavy
guns up hills, or what in England would be called
mountains, by tackles and purchases.</p>

<p>The commander of the French fort was perfectly
astonished to see the places the guns had been dragged
up in so short a time; and Suchet, who calculated
upon its holding out ten days, was in a great rage
when he heard it had been taken in five. I have his
address to his corps upon the subject by me now, in
which he informs his army “that a military commission
will sit upon the conduct of the commander of the
fortress of Balaguer.”</p>

<p>We had done our part, and were looking for intelligence
from our army before Tarragona with anxiety,
as we could at night see the shells in the air, and hear
the firing on both sides.</p>

<p>Colonel Prevost, and Captain Charles Adam, of the
<i>Invincible</i>, thinking it advisable to make a reconnaissance
towards Tortosa to gain intelligence of the
advance of the French marshal (for the information
we got from the Spaniards was so vague that we
could place no dependence upon it), on the morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span>
of the 9th of June they, in company with Lieutenant-Colonel
Hamilton, Captain Arabin (Royal Artillery),
Captain Du Cane, of the 20th Light Dragoons, with
four of his men and myself, started from the castle we
had taken, at three in the morning, all well mounted,
to try and get a peep into Tortosa, about twenty
miles from Balaguer, and where it was reported
Suchet was to arrive in the course of the day.</p>

<p>After a pleasant ride of about sixteen miles, and
as we had just got a glimpse of Tortosa, on reaching
the summit of a hill we all at once entered a serpentine
road, surrounded by high banks and ravines,
which completely prevented our seeing beyond a short
distance. Jogging on quietly, we met an old Spanish
woman thumping two mules past us as hard as she
could, calling out, “Los Franceses, los Franceses,”
but not a word more could we get out of the <i>signora</i>.
We, therefore, rode on to the next turn of the road,
when, just at the corner, plump we came upon the
advance guard of the French army, a regiment of
cuirassiers. They for a moment stopped their horses,
being as much surprised to see us as we were to meet
them. With one glance they saw who we were&mdash;out
came their carbines and swords&mdash;pop, pop, and a
charge, which knocked over one of our dragoons, and
“<i>sauve qui peut</i>,” or the devil take the hindmost,
became the order of the day. Away we scampered&mdash;they
after us, with a regular view halloa, and a
flourish of French fashionable words, but not of the
most select phraseology. Reader, if you wish to
know them, I refer you to the scene of Madame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
Rambouillet and the Novice in Sterne’s “Sentimental
Journey.” After a capital gallop of four miles, we
regularly beat them, with the loss of only one of our
party, who in the charge was knocked head over heels
and taken prisoner. Luckily for us we had left a
corporal’s guard of the 20th Light Dragoons about
four miles in our rear upon a steep eminence, which
commanded a good view of part of the road. The
corporal, seeing how matters stood, and that we were
coming back a deuced deal faster than we went, with
a French regiment of cavalry after us, very cleverly
came trotting up, and showed himself at the top of
the hill with his men. The enemy, thinking we had
a strong body of cavalry there, pulled up their horses
and gave over the chase.</p>

<p>Our ride had not been for nothing&mdash;we had had a
good gallop, and found out where our neighbours
were, who towards evening drove in our picket of
dragoons, and established themselves not far from us.</p>

<p>News was immediately sent to Lieutenant-General
Sir John Murray, who was before Tarragona, of the
arrival of the French army in our neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Our situation was strong, and having the castle,
which commanded the road, neither cannon nor
cavalry could pass from Tortosa. Marshal Suchet
came the next day and had a peep at the fortress,
sent some light troops across the mountains to feel
us, and halted his army a few miles off.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Sir John Murray, as I said
before, had nearly 20,000 men, but, unfortunately for
him, only 5000 were British and Germans&mdash;the rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
Spaniards and Sicilians, on whom he could place no
dependence in the hour of need&mdash;otherwise no general
ever had a better opportunity of beating a divided
army.</p>

<p>We had stopped Suchet, with his 10,000 men, from
advancing on the Valencia side by the capture of the
castle of Col de Balaguer: therefore he would only
have had to cope with the Barcelona corps of 8000,
and the Lerida of 2000 men, so that, after leaving
a sufficient number of men to carry on the siege for a
day or two, which the rear-admiral even offered to
do with the sailors and marines alone, he might have
beaten the enemy in detail. I am speaking, supposing
he had had 16,000 or 20,000 British or German
soldiers; but really with such a set, strong in point
of numbers, but wanting the vigour and bottom of
English troops, it certainly would have been running
a great risk, and he had not the nerve to
attempt it.</p>

<p>Great blame was attached to the general for embarking
in such a hurry, and leaving his guns and
stores behind. The gallant, clever naval chief felt it
most severely, fearing lest any blame should be
attached to him for not taking on board the stores
and artillery: he, therefore, remonstrated very warmly
upon the subject, but it was in vain.</p>

<p>The whole may be summed up in a few words.
Marshal Suchet retired to Tortosa&mdash;the Lerida corps
back to their old quarters&mdash;the Barcelona retrograded
also&mdash;the Anglo-Spanish and Sicilian army embarked
in a hurry&mdash;we blew up the castle of Balaguer that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
had been taken&mdash;the French garrison of Tarragona
sallied forth, took all our battering train and stores,
which we had been collecting, at a great expense, for
months before, into the town, and played checkmate
with the guns that had taken Badajos, for it was the
same train. In short, all the troops ran away from
each other the same day.</p>

<p>No sooner was the army embarked than the commander
of the forces, learning that the French corps
had retired, requested they might be re-landed the
next day, which was complied with, but it was then
too late&mdash;we had lost our battering guns and stores,
and nothing could be done.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Lord William Bentinck arrived
shortly afterwards, the troops were again embarked,
and I was ordered to proceed to Alicant and take on
board Sir John and Lady Murray, and convey them
to Palermo, he being appointed to the command of
the forces there.</p>

<p>I found the Honourable Lady John Murray a
most agreeable, clever, sensible, pleasant woman, and
Lieutenant-General Sir John Murray a very amiable
man in private life, and although much condemned at
the time for not fighting Marshal Suchet and taking
Tarragona, yet neither those who had the command
of the army previous to him, nor General Lord
William Bentinck, who took the command of the
troops from Sir John Murray, gained more laurels or
succeeded much better than he did.</p>

<p>To move and manage a Spanish army in those
days was next to an impossibility. They were too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
proud to be taught, and too ignorant and obstinate to
do anything of themselves.</p>

<p>Having landed my passengers at Palermo, I embarked
three hundred of the 44th Regiment to join
the army of Lord William Bentinck on the coast of
Catalonia. I met at the above city Viscount and
Viscountess Mahon, with their two children, fine boys
of ten and eleven years’ old. His lordship wished to
go to Minorca, and, as we had orders to touch there,
I had much pleasure in giving them a passage.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Port Mahon we were placed
under quarantine, which prevented my landing Lord
and Lady Mahon and family. The accommodation
being not suited to ladies at the lazaretto, I was
delighted when my amiable passengers made up
their minds to remain on board.</p>

<p>Having received orders to proceed to the coast of
Catalonia with the troops, we sailed at the end of
August for the mouth of the river Ebro, but, not
finding the expedition there, we shaped our course
for Tarragona, and on the 4th of September joined
the admiral, who directed me to land the 44th Regiment
at Villa Nova. The town of Villa Nova and
the village of Veneros nearly join. There is an open
roadstead for ships, and the winds from the S.E. to
S.W. throw in a heavy swell upon the bar and beach.
The holding ground is good, and numerous vessels
during many parts of the year arrive for the purpose
of shipping wine, which is either rafted off or taken
on board in the country boats. The wine is most
excellent, and of different kinds, both white and red.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
The latter is so good, and so much resembles port,
that when I was there ten ships and brigs were lying
in the roads taking it in, to be landed at Oporto, and
converted into port wine for the English market. I
was informed that there were annually sent from this
place to Portugal ten thousand pipes. Another very
pleasant wine there was, “Alba Flora,” besides sweet
wines of various kinds, one of which had the sparkling
qualities of champagne.</p>

<p>It had been blowing strong from the southward
previous to our arrival, and the swell had not gone
down.</p>

<p>Between the ships and the landing-place was a
bar, on which the sea broke with great violence, and
which boats had to pass. Those belonging to the
country being well calculated for going through the
breakers, and whose crews were acquainted with the
place, dashed through the surf extremely well.</p>

<p>I thought that by following them in my shell of a
gig, and waiting for a smooth, after three successive
waves had broken upon the bar, I might get safe also;
but I was soon taught a different lesson&mdash;the sea was
more nimble than the gig, and although the men pulled
to the utmost to go faster than the breakers, yet they
beat us hollow, and taking the boat up on one of their
white tops, spun us over in a moment. Fortunately
we had not far to swim, and as soon as the waves had
beaten us over the bar we got into quite smooth water,
when, sticking to the boat and oars, we soon reached
the shore, though not without a precious good ducking.
We had, unfortunately, the viscountess’s poor abigail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>
in the boat, who never before had had such a swim in
salt water, so it was something new to her, and gave
her an opportunity of adding a paragraph to her letter
when she wrote home, describing her foreign travels by
sea, land, and <i>under the water</i>. She was nearly
drowned, poor thing! but keeping her on her back we
swam with her ashore. She was carried to a Spanish
house, wrapped up in blankets, where a few drops of
comfort in the shape of brandy, and some hours’ repose,
made her as lively as a lark again.</p>

<p>By the way of drying myself, and getting the salt
water out of me, I mounted a mule, and rode to Villa
Franca, the head-quarters of our army, distant about
thirteen miles, to see some old military friends.</p>

<p>The country around was very pretty, and we had a
fine view of the celebrated Mount Serrat, rising from
a plain in numerous mountains and spires,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> with
convents upon them; but the whole of that part of
the country was forbidden ground, being occupied by
the French army. On my return in the evening I
visited my water-nymph, and was happy to find her
quite recovered from the severe morning’s ducking. I
offered to take her off again with me in the gig, which
she, like a wise woman, declined; being a novice in
the art of swimming, and not liking the first lesson I
gave her, she preferred returning to the ship next day
in a country boat. The day having turned out fine,
the swell towards evening had somewhat gone down,
though it was still so great that I was nearly swamped
going back to the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>On taking leave of the gallant Rear-Admiral Benjamin
Hallowell next day, he gave me a letter of
thanks, and did me the honour to say he was sorry to
part with me; the regrets were mutual, for it was a
pleasure to be under the command of an officer of his
abilities and experience. He has not many months
ago paid the debt of nature, full of years and honours,
beloved and respected by all who knew him, and
generally regretted by the service. He was one of
those</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Such men as Lords Howe, Duncan, St. Vincent,
Nelson, Saumarez, Keats, Hallowell, &amp;c., are not
mushrooms of a day’s growth, but the experience of a
long and hazardous service in all parts of the world
had braced their nerves and trained their minds to the
task, which they performed with such <i>credit</i> to themselves
and <i>honour and glory to their country</i>.</p>

<p>On the 8th September we sailed from this anchorage
for Tarragona, which place the French had evacuated,
having first destroyed most of the guns and blown up
part of the fortifications. Everything looked miserable
and wretched in the extreme. Many of the houses
were knocked to pieces, and the poor inhabitants, returning
back to view the birthplaces of themselves
and ancestors, found them reduced to a heap of ruins.
I rode with my agreeable passengers to Reus, the
second largest town in the province of Catalonia,
where we dined after the Spanish fashion upon olla
podrida, and other messes, stuffed full of garlic and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
bad oil. After walking about the town, and looking
at a handsome church, the windows of which were of
stained glass, we returned on board and sailed for
Valencia. The peasantry of this province and of
Catalonia are as fine a race of men as I ever saw in
any country&mdash;tall, strong, and well made.</p>

<p>On the 15th September we anchored off the Grao de
Valencia, and the next morning communicated with
our consul according to orders, and landed Viscount
and Viscountess Mahon and family, who took up their
abode with Mr. Tupper, our representative, who was
very civil and polite, and showed us the lions of the
city. The cathedral was very fine, from the top of
which we had a most magnificent view of a very fertile
valley, producing rice, maize, flax, and other grain,
besides almond and vine trees, the latter covered
with beautiful purple and white grapes.</p>

<p>A small river runs past Valencia, over which are
two tolerably fine stone bridges. We had a view also
of the lake of Albufera, from which the French
marshal, Suchet, derives his dukedom.</p>

<p>Valencia is one of the best towns I have seen in
Spain, and the road from the grao, or beach, is extremely
pretty, having trees planted on each side, to
afford shelter from the sun. Neat little thatched
cottages, scattered here and there, put me for a short
time in mind of England.</p>

<p>After dinner at the consul’s, which was served up in
the Spanish style, we went to the opera, and sat in a
box with some pretty Spanish ladies, friends of Mr.
Tupper. The opera was in honour of the Marquis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
of Wellington. It represented the Spaniards driving
the Moors out of Spain; afterwards we had a fandango,
and the whole concluded with a farce, the
subject taken from Gil Blas, where he entertains at
supper the sycophant.</p>

<p>Having re-embarked Viscount and Viscountess
Mahon, I sailed for Altea Bay to complete our water.
Altea has an export trade of almonds and raisins;
several vessels during the summer and autumn months
call there for a cargo. The anchorage is good, and
sheltered from most winds, except those from south-east
by east to south-south-west, which seldom blow
direct on shore. I rode out several heavy gales there
in the frigate I commanded, by giving her nearly two
cables.</p>

<p>From this place we proceeded to Alicant, where we
landed some stores for the garrison; and after showing
the Viscount and his amiable lady the celebrated
castle, we went to Gibraltar, where we unfortunately
found the yellow fever raging to that degree amongst
the inhabitants, that all intercourse was forbidden.
The garrison was encamped on Europe Point, for the
benefit of more air.</p>

<p>On the 5th October we sailed for England, touching
at Lisbon on our way, and after a stormy passage of
three weeks anchored in Plymouth Sound, from which
place we were sent to the Motherbank to perform three
weeks’ quarantine. On the 20th of November we
moved to Spithead, where I landed my most agreeable
and pleasant passengers with very great regret. I had
had them on board for more than three months, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span>
that my cabin felt quite a desert without their
society.</p>

<p>After being detained at Portsmouth a few days, we
proceeded to the Downs, and on the 14th December
between six and seven hundred of His Majesty’s
37th and 56th Regiments were sent on board, with
orders from Admiral Foley for me to land them at
Goree, or the Brill, or Helveot Sluys; but owing to
the winds and tide we were unable to fetch either.
I therefore anchored off Schevelling, and communicated
with our ambassador, Lord Clancarty, at the Hague,
who desired the troops to be landed at the village of
Schevelling. His excellency wishing to see me at the
Hague, I went there to wait upon his lordship.</p>

<p>The little I was enabled to see of Dutchland, gave
me a favourable opinion of the cleanliness of its
people; and the neat pretty cottages from the beach
to the city struck me as being particularly picturesque.
Schevelling itself is nothing but a fishing place amongst
sand hills; but the town of the Hague was neat, and
in summer must be a pleasant place. But as the
severe winter of 1813 was just commencing, I was
obliged to hurry off from the coast as fast as possible,
for fear of being caught upon a lee shore.</p>

<p>On our passage back to the Downs, the two branch
pilots very nearly ran the ship upon the Galloper
Sands in a fog, which obliged us to anchor off the
light for a tide. The next day, however, we arrived
safely in the Downs, and from thence we were sent to
Sheerness to be docked and refitted.</p>

<p class="summary">1814&mdash;Sent to Bermuda&mdash;Operations in the Chesapeake&mdash;The River
Patuxent&mdash;Expedition to Washington&mdash;Town of Rappahannock&mdash;River
Rappahannock&mdash;Wedding Party&mdash;Commodore Robert Barrie,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class="p2">The ship having undergone the necessary repairs,
which was very heavy work during the severe winter
of 1813, towards the end of March we sailed for
Spithead, where we embarked three hundred and
fifty marines, and proceeded, in company with the
<i>Tonnant</i> (80), <i>Regulus</i> (44), and <i>Melpomene</i> (38), <i>en
flute</i> to Bermuda, at which place we arrived after a
passage of eight weeks.</p>

<p>Nothing particular occurred on our voyage out,
except my having the measles very badly, which, not
knowing what ailed me, I had driven inwardly by
cold bathing.</p>

<p>We remained at Bermuda until the 3rd of July,
when, in company with the <i>Asia</i> (74), <i>Regulus</i>, and
<i>Melpomene</i>, we proceeded to the Chesapeake, and
made Cape Henry on the 11th, and anchored in
Synhaven Bay. The following morning we proceeded
up the Chesapeake, and on the 15th joined Rear-Admiral
Cockburn in the <i>Albion</i> (74), who was lying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
at anchor, with two frigates, at the entrance of the
river Patuxent.</p>

<p>I was placed under the orders of Captain J. Nourse,
of the <i>Severn</i> (44), and sent up the river Patuxent for
the purpose of assisting to blockade the American
flotilla, under Commodore Barney, whose broad
pennant was flying in a sloop of eight guns, and
who had under his command seventeen gun-boats,
each carrying a long 32, 24, or 18-pounder in the
bow, and a 32-pound carronade in the stern, and
manned with a crew of from sixty to seventy men.</p>

<p>We ran thirty miles up the river, to the village
of Benedict, in company with the <i>Severn</i>, <i>Ætna</i>, and
<i>Manly</i> (brig).</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Cockburn proceeded with the others
into the river Potomac to annoy the enemy in that
quarter. As we advanced, the gun-boats retreated up
the river to a town called Nottingham, twenty-five
miles above Benedict, where, from the shoalness of
the water, we could not follow them with the ships.
During the time we continued in the Chesapeake we
had guard-boats rowing every night to prevent the
Yankees from trying the effect of their torpedoes or
fire ships.</p>

<p>From the 17th of July until the 17th of August our
time was taken up in making incursions into different
parts of the country, with 300 marines, attacking and,
to use an American expression, “scaring the militia,”
getting fresh provisions, destroying their store-houses
and other public buildings, with the arms found there.
Some of the Americans used to say, “What did King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
George send you here from the old country to come
and scare us for? We don’t go to yours to frighten
you, I guess. Your confounded sarpents come and
anchor in our waters; then send their barges, full of
armed men, who are pulling about day and night,
landing here and there, scaring us and our families
very considerably&mdash;tarnation seize them.” Our reply
used to be, “You must ask your President, Jim
Madison: he invited us.”</p>

<p>A great many black slaves, with their families, used
to take advantage of our visits to come away with us.
Some of their first exclamations were, “Me free man;
me go cut massa’s throat; give me musket,” which
many of them did not know how to use when they
had it.</p>

<p>Another favourite expression, when we wanted
them to work, was, “No, me no work&mdash;me free man.”
It was, therefore, necessary to explain to these new
freemen&mdash;which explanation, I fear, will frequently
have to be repeated in our West India colonies, with
other arguments&mdash;that we must all work and gain
our livelihood by the “sweat of our brow,” whether
bond or free; but they considered work and slavery
synonymous terms.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>Republicans are certainly the most cruel masters,
and the greatest tyrants in the world towards their
fellow men. They are urged by the most selfish
motives to reduce every one to a level with, or even
below themselves, and to grind and degrade those
under them to the lowest stage of human wretchedness.
But American liberty consists in oppressing
the blacks beyond what other nations do, enacting
laws to prevent their receiving instruction, and working
them worse than donkeys. “But you call this a
free country, when I can’t shoot my nigger when I

<p>While on the coast of America we embarked from
fifteen hundred to two thousand slaves&mdash;the young
men we formed into a black corps, and, taking
possession of the small islands of Tangiers, we drilled
and endeavoured to make our recruits of some use.
The aged men, with the women and children, were
sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and from thence a free
colony was formed at the island of Trinadada, in the
West Indies.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of July and the month of
August some parts of this coast are subject to
tornadoes. We had one of them on the 25th of July,
which obliged us, although lying at anchor in a river,
to let go a second. The previous day and that morning
had been extremely close and sultry. The storm came
on from the north-west, with the greatest violence, accompanied
by a few claps of thunder and vivid flashes
of lightning: such was its force that, although in
smooth water, the ship heeled so much over that our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
main-deck guns nearly touched the water; and a fine
schooner of seventy tons burthen, tender to the <i>Severn</i>,
with a long 18-pounder on board, at anchor near us,
without topmasts, her sails furled and gaffs on deck,
was turned bottom upwards in a moment, and one
poor fellow drowned. Its fury was spent in about ten
minutes, but during its continuance we saw immense
trees torn up by the roots, barns blown down like card
houses of children, and where the strength of the
current of wind passed scarcely anything could withstand
its violence. Trees and other things continued
to be swept by us for sometime, and when the tornado
was over we observed, at a turn of the river, so much
large timber, lumber, and other articles floating down
the tide that my gallant senior officer, Captain Nourse,
who is since dead, poor fellow! thought at first it was
the American flotilla coming to attack us, and he was
just on the point of returning to his ship to prepare
for a fight, he having come on board to dine with me,
when I discovered, by means of a spy-glass, the
approaching flotilla was perfectly harmless.</p>

<p>This circumstance was mentioned a short time
afterwards to that <i>most gallant</i> officer, Captain Napier,
who commanded the <i>Euryalus</i>, but Charley would not
believe that the force of wind could upset a schooner
of seventy tons, lying at anchor with all her sails furled,
with her gaffs on deck, and without even top-masts;
however, on the dashing, brilliant expedition, under
Sir James Gordon, up the Potomac to Alexandria,
above Washington, he had an opportunity of judging
for himself when (part of a tornado passing across the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span>
bows of the frigate) he saw in a moment both his bowsprit
and fore-topmast broken in two, like twigs.</p>

<p>Having heard that the enemy’s gun boats had
moved down from Nottingham towards Benedict, on
the 10th August I was ordered to proceed twenty
miles up the river with five boats to reconnoitre. On
landing I was informed they had been there two days
before, but that they had returned to Upper Marlborough.
On rowing up the river we fell in with a
canoe, containing one white man, who was pulling
from Leonard creek to the opposite shore; on seeing
us he endeavoured to get to land, but not being able
to do so, jumped overboard and was drowned. We
had every reason to believe he was one of our deserters.</p>

<p>On the 13th I again went up the river to ascertain
the movements of Commodore Barney, but gained
little information further than that he was with the
flotilla at Nottingham.</p>

<p>The next day we received an account of a party of
American militia having arrived in the woods, at the
back of our watering-place, with the intention of surprising
some of our men; we therefore landed before
daylight between three and four hundred marines and
seamen, headed by Captain Nourse and myself, accompanied
by Captain Coles, R.M., and separated into
four parties, with the hope of being able to cut some
of them off; but from the thickness of the woods and
their knowledge of the country, the enemy succeeded
in getting away from us.</p>

<p>On one of our foraging excursions we were beset
by a being so well described by old Cobbet, in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
“Cottage Economy,” ycleped “Methodist parson,” who
put on his canonicals, and began to whine and cant,
and wished to preach a sermon on peace. Captain
Nourse very properly told him to be off&mdash;that we
must attend to our “calling” as well as he to “his,”
that Jim Madison had “called us,” and, therefore, we
must perform our duty.</p>

<p>About this time a private of the marines belonging
to my ship did a very gallant thing: to use an Irishism
he surrounded three American dragoons, and took
them, horses and all, prisoners. His name was Pat
Gallaghen, or Gahagen. He effected this extraordinary
feat in the following manner:&mdash;whenever boats were
sent for water a sergeant’s party of marines accompanied
them, it being necessary to post videttes to watch for
the approach of an enemy. The casks in the launch
had been filled, and all the party, except this man,
who was placed near a stack of hay, had withdrawn.
While the picket, who had to descend a cliff towards
their boats, were out of sight, Pat observed five dragoons
ride down to the corner of a wood, near a gate; keeping
his eye on the party, he concealed himself behind the
hay-rick, two of the men remained inside the gate, a
long musket-shot off, whilst the others, after ascertaining,
as they thought, that no <i>Britishers</i> were near, came
galloping up to see the boats go off, and without observing
the sentry in his hiding place, halted. The
marine, very bravely putting his musket to his shoulder,
called out&mdash;“You three d&mdash;&mdash; rascals, if you do not
immediately jump off your horses and deliver yourselves
up prisoners I’ll shoot the whole of you at once,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
for I have you all in a line.” Off they got, and the
sergeant at that moment shewing his head above the
cliff to recall the vidette, they were very quietly taken
to the beach, and themselves and horses brought safely
on board.</p>

<p>This brave man, from his immoderate fondness of
liquor, was unfit to be promoted; therefore, all that
could be done for him was to give him the money
arising from the sale of the horses. Now, here was a
proper subject for a medal or order of merit, which
might have had the effect of rousing his pride, and
curing him of the baneful evil of drinking to excess.
But alas! it was the fashion to confer such distinctions
on a very few.</p>

<p>Look at the brave fellows who gained the battles of
the Peninsula! With the exception of Waterloo, no
field was honoured with a medal.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> Of the navy, not
a man below the rank of captain obtained any badge
of distinction, notwithstanding the many general engagements
that took place, and the numerous most
daring boat expeditions met with the same neglect.
Since it was impossible to grant promotion in every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
instance, this would have been an easy and gratifying
mode of awarding the meed of praise to many deserving
individuals.</p>

<p>I am not particularly fond of France or of any
foreign country, but I must do the continental powers
the justice to say they understand human nature, and
know when to reward their officers and men better
than we do. The practice of making their sentries
carry arms to the veteran with his medal or order of
merit works wonders on the <i>morale</i> of their soldiers;
and I do <i>most sincerely and conscientiously believe</i> that,
had this plan been adopted in our army and navy
during the late war, not one half of the <i>desertions or
punishments</i> would have taken place in either service.</p>

<p>It is revolting to honourable feeling to meet in
society at home or abroad, foreigners from nearly all
nations covered with insignias or medals; while we,&mdash;who
have had the pleasure of beating them in every
part of the world, and which, with God’s blessing,
should our king and country need our services, we
shall be too happy to do again,&mdash;have neither.</p>

<p>On the 17th of August, the <i>Tonnant</i> (80), Vice-Admiral
Sir A. Cochrane; <i>Royal Oak</i> (74), Rear-Admiral
P. Malcolm; several frigates and smaller
men-of-war, with twenty sail of transports, having on
board the 4th, 21st, 44th, and 85th Regiments of foot,
and the marine battalion, under Lieut.-Colonel Malcolm,
joined the squadron under the command of
Rear-Admiral Cockburn, at the mouth of the river
Patuxent. The land forces were commanded by the
gallant Major-General Ross. We weighed on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span>
morning of the 20th, and sailed up the river to Benedict,
where we landed the troops, which, including
artillery, sailors, and marines, did not muster more
than 4500 men.</p>

<p>On the evening of the above day all the boats of
the fleet, manned and armed, divided into divisions
and sub-divisions, of which I commanded one, left the
ships, advanced up the river towards Lower Marlborough
to attack the American gun-boats, under
Commodore Barney, and likewise to act on the right
flank of our army. As we advanced, the enemy’s
flotilla retired sixty miles further up the river to a
place called Pig Point, where, in a most favourable
position for defence, surrounded by banks and narrow
creeks, with a wooded country on one side, and hills
on the other, which were to have been lined with
riflemen and other troops, it was their intention to
have awaited the attack.</p>

<p>Late in the evening of the 21st the boats reached
Nottingham, when we fired on a few American
dragoons, and drove them out of the town. Our
army arrived a short time afterwards. The next day,
at noon, we came up with the vessels of the enemy,
who on our approach set them on fire, and blew them
all up, except one, which, together with five merchant
schooners, we brought away. This service was performed
with little loss on our side, for the advance of
our infantry had driven the Americans from the
woods, who had fallen back upon the main road to
Washington. One division of boats proceeded to
Upper Marlborough to keep up a communication<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
with our army; the remainder occupied a position at
Pig Point to cover a retreat.</p>

<p>No sooner was the flotilla destroyed than the
brave and dashing Rear-Admiral Cockburn joined
the troops, and marched with them to attack the city
of Washington.</p>

<p>This most gallant and daring affair was accomplished
by 4500 British infantry, after first beating an
American army of more than four times their own
number, with their President, “Jim Madison,” at their
head, who appeared on the field of battle mounted
upon a white horse, and wearing a huge cocked hat.
He addressed the American army previous to the
battle of Bladensburgh, and recommended them to
do their duty and fight well for the honour of their
country, kill and make prisoners of all the Britishers,
and then, wishing them success, and saying fighting
was not in his province&mdash;he left that to the gallant
generals who understood the art of war&mdash;he put spurs
to his horse, and rode off to Washington to order refreshments
and a grand <i>fête</i> to be got ready at the
capital for the victorious army of the United States.</p>

<p>General Ross, Rear-Admiral Cockburn, and all the
field officers of the to-be-captured army, were to have
been invited; but they forgot the advice of Mrs.
Grundy in her cookery book, “Catch your hare first.”
This is an absolute fact, for when our troops entered
Washington the evening of the battle, tables were
very elegantly laid out in the rooms of the President’s
house, and wine placed in coolers ready iced, which
the <i>great politeness</i> of the Americans left free for us to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>
drink, for fear their presence might prevent our people
feeling quite at home and at their ease.</p>

<p>But to return to the advance of our troops. No
sooner did the enemy see the steady and undaunted
forward movement of part of the 4th, with the whole
of the gallant 85th Regiment,&mdash;commanded by two
fine, brave, dashing fellows, Colonel Thornton and
Major Brown,&mdash;attempt to pass the bridge over the
river Potomac, “which they had left to allow the
Britishers to cross, that they might take them all
prisoners” (the Americans having destroyed all the
others), than they opened a most destructive fire from
their heavy batteries of 24-pounders, which they had
thrown up to enfilade it, and which were commanded
by a brave old fellow of the United States’ Navy,
Commodore Barney, who was wounded and taken
prisoner, and whose flotilla of gun-boats we had
previously destroyed at Pig Point, in the river
Patuxent. He, however, made his escape with seven
or eight hundred seamen, joined the American army,
and was of great service in working and firing the guns
in their field batteries, which were supported by a
very heavy fusilade of musketry.</p>

<p>The round and grape shot from the heavy guns
in battery made fearful gaps in the ranks of the
advancing column, but, nothing daunted, they gave
three cheers, and rushed on in the most daring
manner, which the enemy observing, it created a
panic amongst them, and they gave way, declaring,
I was informed, “that it was of no use their staying
there to be shot, for the Britishers did not mind being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>
killed at all.” So off they went, and never stopped
until they got on the other side of Washington.</p>

<p>The whole of the narrative of the attack on Washington
and Baltimore has been so ably and faithfully
described by the gallant author of the “Subaltern,”
that I shall confine myself to our naval affairs, but
I thought the above anecdotes, which are not mentioned
in his work, were worth preserving to show
the character of the natives.</p>

<p>After having been twelve days and nights in an
open boat, I was not sorry to return to my ship, but
the moment the troops were re-embarked, a difficult
navigation down the river precluded all idea of rest.</p>

<p>The fag to officers and men of every description,
during the whole of the operations in the Patuxent,
was very harassing, and the labour of getting up to
Baltimore without pilots, feeling our way with the
lead, whilst boats on each bow and one a-head were
sounding also, gave little time for respite. The heat
of the weather too was very great, the thermometer
varying only from 79° to 82° in the shade, during
most of our severest services, which added much to
the exhaustion.</p>

<p>On the 8th of September we again landed the troops,
now reduced to four thousand men, at a place called
North Point, on the right hand side of the Patapsco
river, leading to Baltimore. It was unfortunate that
we ever attempted it, for most of the enemy’s army
beaten at Washington had been sent to strengthen
the works, and the whole population were in arms
against us. The Americans seeing us approach, very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span>
wisely brought out several large ships and sunk them
in the channel, under the guns of Fort Mac-Henry,
which prevented the naval part of the expedition from
acting near enough to be of any use with their guns.</p>

<p>The only chance perhaps that might have given any
hope of success was the offer of the gallant Rear-Admiral
Cockburn to make a dash with all the boats
of the fleet, and try and storm Fort Mac-Henry,
keeping the troops on board until the issue of this
measure was decided. Could we have once got possession
of it, the little army might have been landed
with ease, and the place been our own in a few hours.
But the higher powers decided against his plan. Poor
General Ross was killed, having been shot by a rifleman
from a tree. He was brought down, wrapped
up in a union jack, attended by his aide-de-camp;
I placed the body in my boat, and sent it on board.
He was beloved and universally respected by both
the army and navy. By his untimely fall the little
hope we had of succeeding vanished, and although
the gallant Brook did all that a man could do, yet
the strength of the enemy’s field-works that they had
thrown up was so great,&mdash;and there being ten to one
against us, intrenched as they were behind breast-works
bristling with cannon,&mdash;caused the admiral to
request the army to fall back, and we re-embarked
them.</p>

<p>Just before Sir Alexander Cochrane left the Chesapeake
some Americans came on board of Sir Pultney
Malcolm’s ship to treat for the exchange of prisoners.
Colonel Brook, and Captain Dix, who commanded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
the <i>Menalaus</i>, frigate, were on board at the time.
Boasting of their good marksmen, Jonathan thought
to be very witty by telling Captain Dix, who was fat
and broad made, “I guess, captain, you cover a deal
of ground. You had better not come on shore, for
our riflemen can shoot a duck through the head with
a single ball at two hundred yards: therefore you will
stand no chance.” “Very probably they are good
shots,” replied Colonel Brook, “but you forget one
thing&mdash;the poor duck was not a soldier with a red
jacket on his back, and a musket, with a bayonet at
the end of it, in his hand, ready to return the fire and
use the steel. That makes a deal of difference with
regard to steady shooting.”</p>

<p>I was placed under the orders of Captain Robert
Barrie, of the <i>Dragon</i> (74), and left with him in
the Chesapeake, having on board part of Colonel
Malcolm’s battalion of marines, commanded by Captain
Coles of that corps, a good and clever officer; the
remainder were embarked in other ships, while the
fleet and transports, under Sir Alexander Cochrane,
proceeded out of the Chesapeake to the southward.</p>

<p>No sooner did our senior officer, Captain Robert
Barrie, find himself free to act according to his own
able judgment, than, with a mind capable of planning,
and a heart as bold as a lion to execute, he undertook
all kinds of expeditions, or, as our commodore used
to call them, “shooting parties.” “Come,” he used
to say, “we have not had a shooting party this some
time: I have just had information that a body of
Yankee militia, with a field-piece or two, are in such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
a place&mdash;we must go and take it from them.” Boats
were manned and armed&mdash;the marine battalion, under
Lieutenant-Colonel Malcolm, about 400 strong, the
commodore always at their head, were put into them,
and away we used to go. Bang, bang from the field-pieces&mdash;a
tiraillade from the American musketry&mdash;three
cheers and a dash from us, and the guns were
ours: the militia taking themselves off to the woods, and
we dragging the guns to our boats, frequently five,
six, and seven miles, with an enemy’s force, double
and treble our numbers, looking at us. In short,
during the time we continued in the Chesapeake the
American militia had no sinecure, for they never
knew where we intended to land, and we had too
much sense to go twice to the same place without an
object in view.</p>

<p>At this period provisions of all kinds began to run
short; it was therefore necessary to put all hands on
half allowance, and make frequent excursions to try
and procure flour and cattle.</p>

<p>On one of these foraging parties, the late Captain
Tom Alexander, at the head of 200 seamen and
marines, did a very gallant thing: he was attacked
by 1,100 American troops,&mdash;with two squadrons of
cavalry and five field pieces,&mdash;while he was busy
getting cattle; the enemy’s horse made a charge, but
not knowing that a swamp was between them and
Alexander’s party, the horses sank up to their chests
in mud, and began floundering about; he immediately
commenced his fire upon them, which put them to the
right-about, leaving half-a-dozen dragoons, who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span>
been thrown from their horses, sticking with their
heads in the mud; some of the sailors mounted these
fellows in a moment, and shoving their heads deeper
into the mire, there left them. After this, he embarked
his men with the exception of three, who were made
prisoners, and returned on board, leaving the cattle
for a more convenient opportunity.</p>

<p>The commodore, on the 1st of November, gave the
following order to his squadron in the Chesapeake:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">“H.M. Ship <i>Dragon</i>, Nov. 1st, 1814.<br />
“Chesapeake Bay.
</p>

<p>“The provisions of the squadron under my command getting extremely
low, and it being very uncertain at this advanced season of the
year when a supply can arrive, I find myself under the painful necessity
of placing the ship’s company and marine battalion on short allowance.</p>

<p>“You are therefore to place the crew and marines on board your
ship upon half allowance, so as to make your provisions last for two
months from this date.</p>

<p>“You will signify to your crew that I trust it will not be necessary
to continue this restriction long, and that I shall try by every means in
my power to procure temporary supplies from the enemy. In the
meantime, I am satisfied their zeal for their country’s cause will point
out the absolute necessity of persevering in the blockade of the Chesapeake
to the last extremity, and that the temporary privations they are
reduced to will be borne with the utmost cheerfulness.”</p>

<p class="right">“(Signed) <span class="smcap">Robert Barrie</span>,<br />
“Captain and Senior Officer.”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In November we proceeded up the river Rappahannock
for the purpose of attacking the American
militia, 600 strong, who had some fieldpieces posted
at Farnham Church.</p>

<p>We first took the town of Rappahannock, driving
the enemy out of it, who ran away so fast that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>
dropped their colours, which we took. On one side of
them, under the American eagle, was this motto,
“Death or victory”; on the other, “Down with the
tyrants.” However, they were “scared” from death,
and ran away from victory. We then attacked the
militia at Farnham Church, and captured two of their
fieldpieces; afterwards returning to Rappahannock we
embarked some flour and tobacco, and then retired
down the river to our ships, without in the least injuring
the town.</p>

<p>We had with us on this expedition Major Brown,
of the 85th Regiment, who had been severely wounded
at the battle of Bladensburgh, and on the falling back
of our army from Washington, he, with several other
officers and men, who were too ill to be removed,
were left behind. He was a fine gallant fellow, and
now commands the 2nd Battalion of Rifles.</p>

<p>I must take this opportunity of confirming two
statements of my gallant friend Captain J. Scott,
which he mentions in his memoirs. First, with regard
to the unjust accusation of plundering: all I can say
is, that I saw nothing of the kind, unless taking provisions
when we were starving upon half allowance
may be called so; but on every principle of war we
were entitled to forage, and for which in many cases
we paid. The orders of both Admiral Cockburn and
Captain Barrie were positive against plundering.</p>

<p>With respect to the second, I can vouch for his
account of the poisoning the spirits at Benedict being
perfectly true. In consequence of what had taken
place, if we wished to eat or drink anything that was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>
found in their houses placed out ready for us upon
their tables, we used to force the natives to eat a part
first, that, in the event of its being poisoned, they
might die with the Britishers.</p>

<p>We used occasionally to purchase cattle from the
Americans. The plan agreed on was this: they were
to drive them down to a certain point, where we were
to land and take possession; for the inhabitants being
all militiamen, and having too much patriotism to sell
food to “King George’s men,” they used to say, “put
the money under such a stone or tree, pointing to it,
and then we can pick it up, and say we found it.”
More ways than one to cheat the old gentleman.</p>

<p>Having seen in some publications several comments
upon our mode of warfare in America, and no person
yet ever having taken the trouble to place the facts
before the public in its different bearings, it is high
time that our side of the question should appear.
According to the old proverb, “there are always
two sides to a story.” The truth of the matter was
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>At the commencement of hostilities, America invaded
Upper Canada, took York Town, and at the
very beginning of a severe winter, having first sacked
the place, and turned the inhabitants out into the
snow to perish, burnt it to the ground. Had it been
taken by storm, after a severe resistance, the laws of
war would have sanctioned the proceedings; but the
case was far different, little or no resistance being
made.</p>

<p>General Sir George Prevost wrote a letter of re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>monstrance,
not only to the American officer commanding
the division, but also to the Government,
reprobating the mode of warfare they had just adopted,
and calling upon both to disapprove of it by a public
manifesto, and punish the parties concerned. An
evasive answer was returned, and we got no redress.
Sir George Prevost sent copies of the correspondence
to the naval commander-in-chief, and retaliation was
in consequence determined upon; and that their
Government might feel we had the power to repay the
favour they had conferred upon poor York Town,
and other places, we had orders to destroy all
public buildings, and such private houses also as
had been fortified or fired from, inasmuch as they
had been placed in the light of a fortress; <i>and the
blaze that burnt York, in Upper Canada, reached
Washington</i>.</p>

<p>This, and the endeavouring to destroy our men-of-war
by torpedoes,&mdash;the blowing up of Lieut. Geddes,
and the barge’s crew of H.M. Ship <i>Ramilies</i> (74), by
means of gun locks fixed in barrels of powder, with
lines made fast to casks of flour, biscuits, or other
“notions,” as Jonathan used to call them,&mdash;were among
the causes which led to our system of warfare.</p>

<p>Small vessels, called coasters, were laden in this
manner:&mdash;the upper part of the hold consisted of an
assortment of all kinds, and the under filled with casks
of gunpowder; they were then placed directly in the
way of our ships at anchor off their harbours, their
crews taking to a boat and making their escape on
shore when they observed our’s near them in chase.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span>
A vessel of this kind was taken by the boat of the
<i>Ramilies</i> (74), off New London, commanded by that
most intelligent and excellent officer, Sir Thomas
Hardy, who, suspecting from the manner she was
thrown in his way that all was not right, had her
anchored two good cables’ length from his ship, and
kept her there two or three hours before he would
allow any person to go on board, thinking that by
that time any mechanism invented for so diabolical a
purpose would explode. After the above period poor
Lieut. Geddes, whom I knew well, volunteered to go
with the barge’s crew to examine the cargo very carefully;
Sir Thomas Hardy still felt doubtful, but was
at length induced by the repeated solicitations of
Geddes to allow him to go, but with particular injunctions
to be careful. It is supposed that in hoisting
up a cask of flour or biscuits they pulled the line that
was made fast from it to the barrel of powder, the
explosion immediately took place, when a lieutenant,
midshipman, and barge’s crew, sixteen in number,
some of the best men in the ship, were blown to
atoms.</p>

<p>This fatal and melancholy catastrophe probably
saved many of our gallant countrymen, as well as
some of our men-of-war, by acting as a warning, and
putting us on our guard against this <i>most dastardly</i>
method of carrying on the war.</p>

<p>The Americans had observed that several of our
ships, the moment they captured a coasting vessel,
hauled her alongside to take out her cargo, which
frequently consisted of flour, biscuits, or other useful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>
articles. They, therefore, fitted out several explosion
vessels on the above plan, hoping thereby to blow up
some of our seventy-four gun ships or frigates, and
very probably they would have succeeded with any
other except the <i>Ramilies</i>, but her wary captain,
fortunately suspecting some trick would be attempted,
never suffered them to come sufficiently near.</p>

<p>These circumstances combined brought about our
visit to Washington. The above is the real state of
the case: it requires no comments, and every just man
must say they were rightly served.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p>On the 10th November, I was ordered up to Sharp’s
Islands, near Baltimore, to cover the <i>Dragon’s</i> tender
and boats, that were sent to capture the steam packet
that went occasionally from thence to French Town,
but they arrived too late, she having crossed before
they arrived. However, they took several schooners
and sloops, and the packet from Baltimore to Elk
Town.</p>

<p>On the 15th of December, Rear-Admiral Cockburn
rejoined the squadron from Bermuda, and gave us
orders to proceed in company with the <i>Dragon</i> (74),
and <i>Regulus</i> (44), and a schooner, to the coast of
South Carolina. Having completed our provisions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>
from a transport brought by the admiral, we left the
Chesapeake on the 18th of December, which none of
the squadron very much regretted, for the heavy north
gales and cold weather made our boat operations in
the Chesapeake anything but agreeable.</p>

the Fort of Point-à-Petre&mdash;An Affair with the American Riflemen in the
Woods&mdash;An Abattis&mdash;Anecdotes of the 2nd West India Regiment&mdash;A
Rattlesnake&mdash;Capture of the Town of St. Mary’s&mdash;Destruction of the
Forts and Barracks&mdash;Nassau, New Providence&mdash;Compliment to the
Royal Marines&mdash;Return Home&mdash;Concluding Remarks.</p>

<p class="p2">On the 11th of January, 1815, we took possession of
Cumberland Island without meeting any resistance.
The marine battalions, commanded by Colonel Richard
Williams and Colonel Malcolm, and the two flank
companies of the 2nd West India Regiment, under
Major Bradley, were disembarked, encamped, and
works thrown up for protection&mdash;rumours being afloat
that the enemy intended to attack us.</p>

<p>Having waited some days for the arrival of the
rear-admiral, and the ships being greatly in want of
water, Commodore Barrie determined on making an
attack upon the fort of Point-à-Petre and the town
of St. Mary’s, South Carolina. The boats of the
squadron were ordered to attack the fort by water,
under the command of two most excellent officers&mdash;Captain
C. B. H. Ross<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> and Captain Samuel Jackson,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
of the <i>Albion</i> and <i>Lacedemonian</i>&mdash;while the Royal
Marine battalion, with the commodore, part of the
2nd West Indian Regiment, and a few seamen, with
myself, landed, to march through the woods and assail
it in the rear. After advancing about a couple of
miles we saw a few riflemen, who immediately retired
into the woods. We kept on a kind of footpath and
soon came to an abattis, behind which the enemy was
posted, who immediately opened a brisk fire, but by
bugling, cheering, and blazing away right and left, we
drove them out and arrived at the fort which they had
abandoned, just as the boats landed. The battery
mounted six 24-pounders, and two brass 6-pounder
field pieces. During this bush-fight a tragic economical
occurrence, worthy of Joey Hume, took place. While
scrambling over the fallen timber of the abattis, after
the American sharpshooters, two blacks of the 2nd
West Indian Regiment stumbled upon one of them;
the rifleman fired and missed, one of the blacks put
his musket to his shoulder and was going to shoot him
when the other called out “Ta’am, why for you poil
king cartridge? tick him, Ta’am, tick him!” which
between the two was immediately accomplished. Each
party lost some killed and wounded, but the woods
being very thick we made few prisoners.</p>

<p>During the time we were here, and at Cumberland
Island, we had some sharp white frosts and a little
ice, two things the West Indian blacks had never seen;
they were puzzled not a little, particularly when they
beheld their own breath. The keen morning air having
rendered their faces of a sickly purple colour, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span>
major enquired what was the matter; their reply was:
“Major, me no know&mdash;me no like it at all&mdash;me no see
’um, but he bity me toe a my finger.” When we
laughed at their droll description, they said, breathing
hard, “Eh! you no see smoke come out of my mouth,
ah! massa major, he bity me toe a my finger!” shaking
and rubbing their hands, and stamping with their feet,
“Bad country this, no like em at all.” Several of these
poor fellows were frost bitten, and lost their limbs.</p>

<p>After the capture of the fort and barracks we embarked,
and proceeded up the river to the town of St.
Mary’s, which surrendered without further opposition.
We made the inhabitants pull down their own fort
and stockade in the town, took possession of the
shipping and stores, and destroyed the public buildings.</p>

<p>A curious thing occurred on board one of the ships:
a rattlesnake <i>versus</i> grog or, finding a Tartar. During
the time I was pulling about, taking possession of
some of the vessels, and sending boats to others, I
was startled by a tremendous noise on board one of
the prizes, and saw the men running up the rigging
in all directions, while others took to the boats. I
went directly alongside to see what was the matter,
thinking that some torpedo or clock-work, such as
had blown up poor Lieut. Geddes, of the <i>Ramilies</i>,
off New London, had been discovered. Upon inquiry
I found that a rattlesnake had been the cause
of all the row. Some of the boats’ crews on going on
board very naturally went down below into the cabin,
and other parts of the ship to see what she contained.
Jack spied in the master’s cabin a large case, the wire-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>work
of which was placed against the ship’s side, and
which in their hurry they had not observed. The
vessel, I must remark, was bound to France. Seeing
this case the thought instantly struck them that it
must contain wine or spirits; they were determined,
after all their toil, to have a good drink before any of
the officers came below; an iron crowbar and cutlasses
soon ripped open the top, when, instead of rum, wine,
or brandy, out jumped a large rattlesnake, at least two
yards’ long&mdash;away flew the sailors up the hatchways,
some got into the boats, others in the rigging, the
snake made one spring up the ladder, and was on deck
after them in a moment&mdash;he soon jumped overboard,
and, the vessel being pretty close to the shore, made
his escape into the rushes and we saw no more of him.</p>

<p>After remaining here a few days, I accompanied
Captain Ross and Captain Jackson forty miles up the
river, to bring down the <i>Countess of Harcourt</i> Indiaman,
that had been captured by a privateer some months
before. In going up and down the river St. Mary’s
we saw several large alligators sleeping on the banks,
which at a little distance were taken for logs of timber,
until they began to plunge into the water; we fired at
several, and observed the balls strike the scales, but
they bounded off, apparently without doing them any
injury. I saw some of the Americans with the upper
part of their shoes made of the skin, it had been
tanned, and wore well, the knobs looked curious. I
regretted afterwards I did not procure some of the
shoes and tanned skins, and bring them home with
me to England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>After returning with the Indiaman, which we loaded
with cotton, etc., I was ordered to proceed to Nassau,
New Providence, to bring 300 more of the 2nd West
India Regiment, it being the intention of the rear-admiral
to make some attack further to the northward.</p>

<p>We reached the Bahamas in ten days, first making
the hole in the rock at the island of Abacco, which is
a most excellent land-mark: it lies in lat. 25°, 56 N.,
long. 77°, 20 W. from London. Then, steering S. by
E., 18 leagues, we arrived off the bar of New Providence,
where we took a pilot to conduct us to the
anchorage. An immense shark followed us over the
bar, and remained by the ship during our stay, and
proceeded with us again when we sailed. The water
was so very clear that we saw him daily at the
bottom. He was too cunning to take bait, though
now and then he would come up to the top, eat
the bones and bits of biscuit thrown overboard, and
try and get the piece of beef off the hook, but never
would swallow it.</p>

<p>On my return from New Providence with troops,
we again took on board part of the marine battalion
from the fort and barracks of Fort Washington at
Point-à-Petre, the guns of which we embarked; then,
blowing up the works and burning the barracks, we
returned to Cumberland Island to plan further
annoyances to the enemy.</p>

<p>While we were absent at the Bahamas, Captain
Phillot, of the <i>Primrose</i>, brig, had been sent ninety
miles up the river to attack some troops and destroy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
their stores of provisions, but the river becoming
narrow, and the Americans lining the banks with
sharpshooters, besides felling trees to stop the boats,
he failed in the object, having lost several men killed
and wounded, amongst the latter Captain Phillot
himself severely. Had the enemy not prematurely
shown their intention, they would have blocked up
the boats, and probably captured them all. As it
was, nothing but the coolness and bravery of the
commander, and officers and men under his orders,
prevented it.</p>

<p>Just at this period we received the news of the
total failure of our southern expedition to New
Orleans, which event gave us deep and sincere
regret, but we hoped by a gallant dash to wipe out
our distressing feelings at such an unfortunate event;
but while in the midst of preparations we received
intelligence that the olive branch of peace was
received, and the demon of war between parent and
child had ceased. Had it arrived immediately after
the taking of Washington, how great would have
been our delight! As it was, although we could
not help feeling a secret pleasure at the prospect
of returning home to our families and friends, yet
the throwing away so many valuable lives in the
swamps of New Orleans cast a damp on our spirits,
and a secret wish to try and blot it from our
memories by some gallant achievement.</p>

<p>Previous to returning to Nassau, I had the honour
to receive a public letter of thanks from my brave
and worthy commodore, Barrie. To have his appro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>bation
was, indeed, a flattering testimonial, and I
look back at this hour with pleasure when we served
together on the other side of the Atlantic, and I
hope, if ever England should be again plunged in
war, that fortune may place me under his command.</p>

<p>On the 6th of March the ship I commanded was
ordered to proceed to Nassau with the 2nd West
India Regiment, and from thence to Bermuda, where
we arrived the beginning of April with a re-captured
English brig. After remaining there a fortnight,
and receiving letters of thanks from Sir Alexander
Cochrane and Rear-Admiral Cockburn, addressed to
my officers and ship’s company, as well as two others
to myself, we proceeded to Halifax, Nova Scotia,
at which place we embarked the 98th Regiment,
Lieutenant-Colonel Douglass, and sailed, in a heavy
snow-storm, on the 20th of May with a convoy of
transports for England, and arrived at Spithead in
June, after a passage of twenty-two days.</p>

<p>From the period of our sailing from Britain (April,
1814) until the same month, 1815, we had been constantly
employed upon a variety of harassing services
and desultory warfare, with the gallant Royal Marine
battalions, under the present colonels, Sir R. Williams<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a>
and Sir John Malcolm, and it would be the height of
injustice not to bear witness to their most brave,
able, and steady conduct on every occasion. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
where did they ever do otherwise? From the sun’s
rising in the east to its setting in the west, in both
hemispheres, it has witnessed the devoted bravery
and loyalty of the whole corps of Royal Marines.</p>

<p>After remaining sometime at Spithead, orders came
for us to embark part of the suite of the Duchess
D’Angoulême. After making the necessary preparations,
and expending some of my own money in the
outfit, we received counter orders.</p>

<p>In August the ship was ordered to Sheerness to be
paid off; on the 23rd I was promoted to the rank of
captain, and on the 9th September the pennant was
hauled down, and I parted from my old officers and
ship’s company with very great regret. Thus ended
my naval services for the present, after nearly seventeen
of the best years of my life in active warfare;
and I have now to thank God for His protection and
providence on many trying occasions.</p>

<p>I shall conclude by making a few remarks before
closing this narrative upon the unfortunate mistake
this country committed with regard to our quarrel
with the United States, and also upon the actions
which took place between our frigates and theirs, and
upon the subject of searching for English sailors on
board their vessels.</p>

<p>The great error that England committed was her
not having declared war against America two or three
years earlier than she did. She ought to have done
it on account of their having aided and assisted our
mortal enemy, by carrying on the trade for France in
vessels belonging to the United States, and not have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
allowed them to become the aggressors, to choose
their own time, and make the first attack. Had she
done so in 1808-1809, or even in 1810, America would
have been completely in our power, for the whole of
her merchant vessels covered the seas, and her few
men-of-war were not particularly well manned. The
embargo had been on two years, by which time most
of her trading vessels were safely returned from every
part of the world; and her seamen being thrown out
of employ, were glad to enter on board their men-of-war
and privateers for the chance of prize money.
But she being now ready, and having secured nearly
all her merchant vessels safe in their own ports, first
insulted the British flag by sending a 58-gun frigate,
the <i>Constitution</i>, to attack the <i>Little Belt</i> corvette
of 18 guns then cruizing on the American coast to
intercept French vessels. This large frigate of 58
guns, and 487 men, <i>very gallantly</i> fired into the little
sloop of war of 18 guns and 120 men, killed and
wounded several of them; but she in a very spirited
manner returned the fire of this greatly superior force,
and killed some of her men. Commodore Rogers, of
the American 58-gun ship, pretended to make an
apology to Captain Bingham, of His Majesty’s ship
<i>Little Belt</i>, by saying he took her for a frigate, or he
should not have fired into her.</p>

<p>This was done with the hope of making England
declare war, and thereby putting the onus upon her,
and making the war in America more popular; but
that failing, and they having an army ready to invade
Canada, urged on by Bonaparte in 1812, threw down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
the gauntlet, and commenced hostilities, uniting with
France against the liberties of Europe.</p>

<p>Their few frigates being beautifully manned, and
immensely superior to ours in size, guns, and number
of men, took three of our 48-gun frigates after a severe
action. But I do maintain the British navy lost no
honour. The enemy’s ships mounted 58 guns, 24 and
42-pounders, with a complement of 487 picked seamen
and marines; whereas our ships carried only 48 guns,
18 and 32-pounders, all badly manned, and one, the
<i>Guerrière</i>, with only 187 men at quarters, the other
two, the <i>Java</i> and <i>Macedonian</i>, had nearly their complement
of 300 men such as they were. The strength,
size, and number of guns of the American ships were
too great for ours.</p>

<p>Persons not conversant with nautical affairs, imagine
that one frigate is as good as another; but that is not
the case, for it is very clear that a man of five feet
four inches, weak in proportion, cannot stand against
a man of six feet, with nearly double his strength,
although both are called men.</p>

<p>Another circumstance must be mentioned, which is
this. A ship capable of carrying 58 or 60 heavy
guns, 30 of which are long 24-pounders on her main
deck, must be a much stronger and larger ship, both
in hull, masts, and yards, and her masts several inches
in diameter bigger than the smaller ship, carrying
only 28 18-pounders on the main deck; therefore
three, indeed two, if in a fresh breeze of wind, 24-lb.
shot striking the main-mast in the same place or
nearly so, of the smaller vessel, would knock it away,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>
whereas it would require double the number of the
18-pound shot to cut away that of the larger ship,
giving so many more advantages to the bigger ship
against the smaller, by the latter being so much
sooner crippled.</p>

<p>The ridiculous, silly, and mischievous hue and cry
that was raised in this country, in consequence of the
above action, by a malicious, envious party, to pluck
from the navy some of her laurels, needs no comment.
It gave a lustre to the above frigate actions of our
enemy all over the world which they did not deserve,
and made them think themselves much more superior
than they were, until the fight between the English
frigate, <i>Shannon</i> (48), Captain Philip Broke, and the
<i>Chesapeake</i> (49), Captain Laurence, off Boston. The
latter had fifty more men than the former, but was
taken in fifteen minutes by the gallant Captain Broke,
and the ship’s company of the <i>Shannon</i>. This brilliant
affair, followed a short time afterwards by the action
of the <i>Endymion</i> (50), Captain Henry Hope, that
mounted 24-pounders on her main deck, and 32-pounders
on the quarter-deck, against the <i>President</i>
(60), 24-pounders and 42-pounders, which she also
captured, proved to them that, when we were more
evenly matched, the navy of England was still mistress
of the seas.</p>

<p>It was long seen by those who chose to make use
of their senses that the disputes between the two
countries must end in a rupture; and that the
American Government were determined to side with
France, and pick a quarrel with us, and that a war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
was inevitable. They knew that the whole attention
of the British Government was taken up by the great
struggle in Europe, and therefore few, if any, troops
could be spared from the great theatre of war on the
Peninsula; they considered this the time therefore to
demand new maritime law.</p>

<p>The right of search (which for ages had been the
acknowledged or assumed law of all European belligerent
nations), for enemies’ merchandize carried in
neutral vessels, America was determined to oppose.
Instigated by intrigues, and offers of all kinds, made
by French emissaries sent for that purpose, Bonaparte
found his Milan decrees, declaring the whole coasts
of Great Britain and her extensive colonies in the
four quarters of the world in a state of blockade, to
be of no use without a navy to support it, and not
having one that dared show its face upon the ocean,
had no means to carry his decrees into execution.
His eagle eye at once saw that by making a tool of
the United States, and embroiling them with England,
he might make a great diversion in his favour. He,
therefore, induced their cabinets to enter into his
plans, backed, it was said, “<i>by good, weighty, golden
reasons</i>, and insisted upon a new maritime law,” which
would strike a death blow at our dominion of the sea,
and at once evade all blockade. The law I allude to
was, that the neutral flag or vessel should permit the
ship wearing it to carry the cargo of an enemy free of
capture from the other belligerent, who met it on the
sea or elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was very extraordinary that America found little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
fault with France, who first commenced the general
blockade by the issue of her Milan decrees, and who
confiscated all the United States’ vessels that were
captured by her men-of-war or privateers with British
colonial or other produce on board, coming directly
or indirectly from any port of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and her colonies. Had they merely
touched or been driven by stress of weather into an
English port, or even boarded by a British cruiser, it
was sufficient to condemn them as lawful prizes in a
French Court of Admiralty, when met at sea by
French armed vessels, and detained. England waited
with great patience, thinking that all the neutral
powers, but above all America, would protest against
the measure, and join her who was fighting for the
liberties of all the world against the iron grasp of
Bonaparte, and his intended universal dominion. The
United States, on the contrary, put up with the seizure
of their vessels by France, and when Great Britain
was obliged, after the greatest forbearance, to declare
the whole coast of France and her allies in a state of
blockade&mdash;which she had the means of doing, having
more than one thousand men-of-war of different sizes
at sea or in commission, ready effectually to carry this
measure into operation&mdash;they grew outrageous because
she would not permit them to be our secret enemy,
and carry the trade of France in their ships, under
the new maritime law they proposed, viz., that a
neutral ship and flag were to make an enemy’s cargo
neutral also. The above was one of the causes that
led to the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>Impressment of seamen or sailors out of their
vessels is another source of complaint against this
country. To this latter act England was driven by
the conduct of citizens of the United States, decoying
men to desert whenever any of our ships, whether
men-of-war or merchant vessels, put into their harbours.
The enticing our seamen away to man
their vessels naturally made us search for British
subjects whenever British men-of-war boarded any of
our ships, whether at sea or in foreign parts, particularly
when we knew the easy method by which English
subjects were naturalised and gained American protections.</p>

<p>I recollect a very fine young seaman whom we took
out of an American ship at Messina in Sicily, when I
was a lieutenant of the <i>Melpomene</i> frigate. On being
brought on board he produced his United States’ protection,
and requested to be sent back to his ship.
He wrote to the American consul to claim him, and
the master of his ship came on board to demand him
as an American citizen. Having strong suspicion
that he was an English subject,&mdash;notwithstanding the
clamour raised by the Yankee master and consul, and
the production of his protection; yet, from his not
having any nasal twang when he spoke, and not using
the general slang words of that country, such as “I
guess,” “I calculate,” etc.,&mdash;we kept him on board that
night. The next morning he came on the quarter-deck
of the frigate, and gave up his American protection
and said, “I will not deny my country&mdash;I am
a native of Swansea, in Wales, and I got that pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span>tection
when I sailed last voyage in a merchant ship
from Liverpool to New York, in the following manner.
On my arrival at New York I was told that by paying
two dollars I could get a protection of citizenship,
which would prevent my being pressed on board an
English man-of-war. The way it was managed was
this:&mdash;I was put into a large cradle made on purpose
to hold men; I was then rocked by them for a minute
or two, and afterwards taken before the proper authorities
by the old couple, who made oath they had known
me ever since I was in my cradle&mdash;no further questions
were asked, the matter being quite understood between
the parties,&mdash;I paid the fees, the protection was granted,
and, having given the old folks two dollars for their
trouble, I became a ‘registered American citizen,’ and
that, sir,” he said, “is the way British seamen are kidnapped
in the States&mdash;in short, it is a regular trade,
and hundreds of seamen that have protections got
them in the same manner.”</p>

<p>A knowledge of the various tricks played on the
other side of the Atlantic to entice away our seamen,
made the officers of the British navy more anxious to
recover their sailors, which of course at times caused
some irritating disputes with the masters and skippers
of the American vessels. These magnified every trifle,
and reported all the circumstances to people who were
paid by that part of the press in the French interest
to make the worst of everything, in order to inflame
the public mind against this country, particularly after
the affair of the <i>Leopard</i> (50), taking our deserters out
of the American frigate <i>Chesapeake</i> (48), and the un<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span>fortunate
event of H.M.S. <i>Leander</i>, when a man was
killed by accident by her firing to bring-to a vessel
under the United States’ flag off New York for the
purpose of examining her.</p>

<p>The Americans acted with great wisdom and foresight
previous to their declaration of war, by putting
on the embargo and passing the “Non-intercourse
Bill” with England two years before. By that wise
act they were enabled to get home their trade from all
parts of the world, and having done this, they insulted
our flag by sending a 58-gun ship, commanded by
Commodore Rogers, to fire into the <i>Little Belt</i> corvette
of 18-guns, commanded by Captain Bingham,
cruising near their coast, and killing several of her
men and wounding others. This affair had two meanings.
First to revenge the death of their citizens slain
in the <i>Chesapeake</i> frigate, and on board the merchant
ship off New York; and secondly to induce us to
declare war against them, to make it more popular
with the generality of the people of the States, that
the Government might be able to throw the blame
upon England. Britain having her hands full in other
places, fighting for the liberties of the world, making
at the same time a desperate struggle for her own
existence, and most nobly striving to liberate other
powers from the grasp of Bonaparte, was not willing
at this most critical period to have another foe; she
therefore tried something in protocol fashion of the
present day, but it failed as all half-measures generally
do.</p>

<p>America laughed at it, and commenced biting our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
heels, while John Bull was tossing the dogs in front.
They had the wisdom to perceive the great error
England had committed in not seeing that war was
inevitable, and that she ought to have declared it two
or three years before, and not have allowed her to get
the whole of her vessels safe into port. Our politeness
and good breeding enabled them to secure all or most
of their shipping, in order to enable them to man
their ships of war and privateers with picked sailors.
Their seamen being thrown out of employ, were glad
to enter on board their men-of-war and privateers for
the almost certain chance of a rich harvest, by capturing
our East and West Indiamen.</p>

<p>This was the great mistake England committed;
for had we gone to war at an earlier period when the
seas were covered with American merchant ships,
they would have been swept into our harbours, and
she would have been completely at our mercy, and
twelve months at that time would have settled our
disputes far more amicably than the unsatisfactory
method adopted in the year 1815.</p>

<p>Natural affection, intimate connections with this
country, a common language, and a wish to incline to
a reasonable adjustment of claims, would probably have
settled our quarrel, and not have left the boundary line
as a further bone of contention. But we were unfortunately
so delighted with the success of our allies and
our own gallant army, by the capture of Paris, and
other deeds in Europe, added to the abdication of
Napoleon, that American matters were left nearly in
the same state as before the war, although we had the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span>
means at that period to have settled everything in a
most satisfactory manner. The country was like,&mdash;or
might be compared to,&mdash;soldiers and sailors who had
received so much pay and prize-money that they got
drunk. Great Britain was intoxicated with the honour
and renown which their countrymen in the army and
navy had gained for them, and never thought of the
morrow. Indeed, up to the present time, 1839, they
have been living upon the <i>principal</i> of <i>credit</i>, for we
have put, I fear, very little by or out to interest which
was <i>then gained</i>, and which has been most woefully
frittered away ever since, until the country has at last
almost run bankrupt: for we are spit upon in Spain,
treated with contempt in Portugal, despised in France,
laughed at in Russia, kicked in Canada, and in a fine
olla podrida in India and China.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX"><i>APPENDIX.</i></h2>
</div>

<p>Having, in the foregoing narrative, stated, in justification of
our mode of warfare in America, some of the causes which led
to our adoption of the system of retaliation, I beg to subjoin two
extracts from the Annual Register of the year 1814, as well as
copies of public documents, which a friend has most kindly
favoured me with, which fully bear me out in saying that we
were in a manner compelled to adopt the system we pursued,
<i>i.e.</i>, to teach the Americans that we had the power to return
with interest the inhuman mode of warfare with which they
began the campaign.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“From several causes it was not to be expected that the war between
Britain and America would be carried on in the most humane and
honourable mode, especially by the Americans; they had not yet
forgotten the war of the revolution, and by our employment of the
Indians, <i>though they set us the example</i>, the consequences were such as
might be dreaded. In their different invasions of Canada, the greatest
inhumanities were exercised; especially at Sandwich, at the settlements
on the Thames, at York, and at Fort George. Finding that remonstrances
against this mode of conducting the war produced no effect,
General Sir George Prevost at length issued a proclamation announcing
a severe retaliation on the Americans, while at the same time he earnestly
deprecated this mode of warfare.”&mdash;<i>Annual Register</i>, p. 318, <i>Principal
Occurrences</i>, 1814.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="p2">
<p>“A proclamation issued by General Sir George Prevost, Bart.,
announces, after long forbearance, a severe retaliation on the Americans
for their inhuman mode of warfare in their different invasions of Canada,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
especially for their having, in the midst of a severe Canadian winter,
wantonly burnt the beautiful village of Newark, and turned out <i>four
hundred helpless women and children</i> to perish in the snow, and through
the severity of the season, <i>without shelter, and without a remnant of
property</i>. This case is made out with the utmost distinctness against
the Americans, not only in this, but in a number of other instances,
at Sandwich, at the settlements on the Thames, at York, and at Fort
George. General Sir George Prevost earnestly deprecates this mode of
warfare; but he justly observes that ‘since it has been so long persevered
in by the enemy, retaliation becomes an imperious duty.’
But he at the same time says, ‘that he will no longer pursue a system of
warfare so revolting to his own feelings, and so uncongenial to the
British character, unless forced to it by the future measures of the
enemy.’”&mdash;<i>Annual Register</i>, p. 27; <i>Principal Occurrences</i>, 1814.</p></blockquote>

<p>I trust that I have fully vindicated our mode of warfare in
America, by showing that we were driven to it by the great inhumanities
so frequently committed by the enemy, and when
forbearance and remonstrance failed, nothing was left but to
teach them that when goaded beyond endurance&mdash;<i>four hundred
helpless women and children turned out to perish in the frost and
snow of a severe Canadian winter</i> from the village of Newark,
besides wanton barbarities committed in various other places&mdash;the
British lion was at length aroused from his slumber, and that
the fires which the Americans had lit in other places, reached
the public works of their capital&mdash;Washington.</p>

and I am instructed to request that you will facilitate his passage to
the Commanding General of the United States’ Army, to whom he is
desirous of making a representation on the subject of the plunder and
destruction of his property by the American troops in this neighbourhood.
And on this subject I am instructed to protest in the most
solemn manner against that system of rapine and plunder of the property
of the peaceful and unoffending inhabitants which has marked the
progress of the American army during its short continuance in this
province; and I am further to entreat that his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief
of the United States’ Army will allow no consideration
arising out of the circumstances of the disparity of rank of the British
officer by whom he is so called upon, to restrain his Excellency from
immediately disavowing this system so disgraceful to a civilized army,
and affording every fair indemnity to the individual sufferers; or that
he will, by an open avowal that the system complained of is an authorized
one, leave it in the option of the general officer (hourly expected
to assume the command of the powerful and rapidly increasing British
force in this neighbourhood), to employ it in such acts of just retaliation
upon the persons and property of the inhabitants of the right bank of
the St. Lawrence as he may think fit, as commensurate with the treatment
of the inhabitants on this side.</p>

inflicted for the destruction of the village of Newark would have
deterred the enemy from similar acts of barbarity; under that impression,
I issued a proclamation of the 4th January last, which has since been
most scrupulously adhered to by the troops under my command, and it
is with painful reluctance I now feel myself compelled to return to a
system so abhorrent to those principles of humanity which have always
